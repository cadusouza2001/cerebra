{"question": "What does setting `spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable` to `true` do?", "answer": "Setting `spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable` to `true` enables write-ahead logs, which provide stronger fault-tolerance guarantees by writing received data to a log before processing."}
{"question": "What potential issue arises when attempting to restart a Spark Streaming application from an earlier checkpoint after an upgrade?", "answer": "Restarting from earlier checkpoint information after an upgrade is not possible because the checkpoint information contains serialized Scala/Java/Python objects, and attempting to deserialize these objects with new, modified classes may lead to errors."}
{"question": "What are the two options presented for handling checkpoint issues after an upgrade in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "After an upgrade, you can either start the upgraded application with a different checkpoint directory, or delete the previous checkpoint directory to resolve potential compatibility issues with the checkpoint data."}
{"question": "What additional information does the Spark web UI provide when a StreamingContext is used?", "answer": "When a StreamingContext is used, the Spark web UI shows an additional Streaming tab which displays statistics about running receivers, such as whether they are active, the number of records received, and receiver errors, as well as information about completed batches, including processing times and queueing delays."}
{"question": "According to the text, which two metrics in the Spark web UI are particularly important for monitoring a streaming application?", "answer": "The two particularly important metrics in the web UI are Processing Time, which indicates the time to process each batch of data, and Scheduling Delay, which represents the time a batch waits in a queue for previous batches to finish processing."}
{"question": "What does it indicate if the batch processing time is consistently longer than the batch interval and the queueing delay is increasing?", "answer": "If the batch processing time is consistently more than the batch interval and the queueing delay keeps increasing, it indicates that the system is unable to process batches as quickly as they are being generated and is falling behind."}
{"question": "What interface can be used to monitor receiver status and processing times in a Spark Streaming program?", "answer": "The StreamingListener interface can be used to monitor the progress of a Spark Streaming program, allowing access to receiver status and processing times, though it is noted as a developer API likely to be improved in the future."}
{"question": "What are the two primary considerations for tuning a Spark Streaming application to achieve optimal performance?", "answer": "To achieve the best performance, you need to consider reducing the processing time of each batch of data by efficiently using cluster resources, and setting the right batch size to ensure data processing keeps up with data ingestion."}
{"question": "What is one way to improve performance by addressing bottlenecks in data receiving?", "answer": "If data receiving becomes a bottleneck, consider parallelizing the data receiving process by creating multiple input DStreams to receive different partitions of the data stream from the source."}
{"question": "How can multiple input DStreams be combined after being configured to receive different partitions of data?", "answer": "Multiple input DStreams can be combined by unioning them together to create a single DStream, allowing transformations to be applied to the unified stream."}
{"question": "What does reducing the block interval do in relation to the number of tasks used to process received data?", "answer": "Reducing the block interval increases the number of tasks that will be used to process the received data in a map-like transformation, as the number of tasks per receiver per batch is approximately calculated as (batch interval / block interval)."}
{"question": "What is the recommended minimum value for the block interval, and why?", "answer": "The recommended minimum value for the block interval is about 50 ms, below which the task launching overheads may become a problem."}
{"question": "What is one alternative to using multiple input streams/receivers for parallel data ingestion?", "answer": "An alternative is to explicitly repartition the input data stream using inputStream.repartition(<number of partitions>), which distributes the received batches of data across the specified number of machines in the cluster."}

{"question": "How does clearing old data work in Spark Streaming, and how can it be customized?", "answer": "Spark Streaming automatically clears old data based on the transformations used; for example, a 10-minute window operation will keep around the last 10 minutes of data and discard older data, but data can be retained longer using `streamingContext.remember`."}
{"question": "What is suggested to reduce GC overheads in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "To reduce GC overheads, it's suggested to persist RDDs using the OFF_HEAP storage level and to use more executors with smaller heap sizes."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between DStreams and receivers in terms of parallelism?", "answer": "A DStream is associated with a single receiver, so to attain read parallelism, multiple receivers—and therefore multiple DStreams—need to be created."}
{"question": "How are blocks of data generated by a receiver, and what determines the number of blocks created during a batch interval?", "answer": "A receiver creates blocks of data every `blockInterval` milliseconds, and the number of blocks created during a `batchInterval` is determined by the formula N = `batchInterval`/`blockInterval`."}
{"question": "What happens when `blockInterval` is equal to `batchInterval`?", "answer": "When `blockInterval` is equal to `batchInterval`, a single partition is created and is likely processed locally."}
{"question": "What is the effect of using `inputDstream.repartition(n)`?", "answer": "Using `inputDstream.repartition(n)` reshuffles the data in the RDD randomly to create `n` number of partitions, which can increase parallelism but comes at the cost of a shuffle."}

{"question": "What is the purpose of the `foreach` action, and what caution is noted regarding its use?", "answer": "The `foreach` action runs a function on each element of the dataset, typically for side effects like updating an Accumulator or interacting with external storage systems, but it's noted that modifying variables other than Accumulators outside of `foreach()` may result in undefined behavior."}
{"question": "What is the shuffle operation in Spark, and why is it considered costly?", "answer": "The shuffle is Spark’s mechanism for re-distributing data so that it’s grouped differently across partitions, and it’s considered a costly operation because it typically involves copying data across executors and machines, as well as disk I/O and data serialization."}
{"question": "How does the `reduceByKey` operation utilize the shuffle mechanism?", "answer": "The `reduceByKey` operation generates a new RDD where all values for a single key are combined, but since values for a single key may not reside on the same partition, Spark needs to perform an all-to-all operation to bring together values across partitions to compute the final result for each key – this process is called the shuffle."}
{"question": "What are some operations that can cause a shuffle in Spark?", "answer": "Operations which can cause a shuffle include repartition operations like `repartition` and `coalesce`, ‘ByKey operations (except for counting) like `groupByKey` and `reduceByKey`, and join operations like `cogroup` and `join`."}
{"question": "Why is the shuffle operation considered expensive in terms of memory usage?", "answer": "The shuffle operation can consume significant amounts of heap memory because it employs in-memory data structures to organize records before or after transferring them, and operations like `reduceByKey` and `aggregateByKey` create these structures on the map side, while ‘ByKey operations generate them on the reduce side."}
{"question": "What is RDD persistence (or caching) in Spark, and what benefits does it offer?", "answer": "RDD persistence (or caching) in Spark is the capability of storing a dataset in memory across operations, allowing future actions to be much faster, often by more than 10x, and is a key tool for iterative algorithms and fast interactive use."}
{"question": "What is the default storage level when using the `cache()` method in Spark?", "answer": "The `cache()` method is a shorthand for using the default storage level, which is `StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY` (store deserialized objects in memory)."}
{"question": "According to the text, what is the primary function of `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` storage level in Spark?", "answer": "The `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` storage level stores RDDs as serialized Java objects, one byte array per partition, which is generally more space-efficient than deserialized objects, especially when using a fast serializer."}
{"question": "How does `DISK_ONLY` storage level handle RDD partitions?", "answer": "The `DISK_ONLY` storage level stores the RDD partitions only on disk, providing a storage option when memory is limited."}
{"question": "What is the key difference between `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` and `OFF_HEAP` storage levels?", "answer": "Both `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` and `OFF_HEAP` store data in serialized form, but `OFF_HEAP` stores the data in off-heap memory, which requires off-heap memory to be enabled."}
{"question": "In Python, how are objects always serialized when using Spark storage levels?", "answer": "In Python, stored objects are always serialized with the Pickle library, regardless of the chosen storage level."}
{"question": "What does Spark do automatically with intermediate data during shuffle operations like `reduceByKey`?", "answer": "Spark automatically persists some intermediate data in shuffle operations, such as `reduceByKey`, even without users explicitly calling `persist`, to avoid recomputing the entire input if a node fails during the shuffle."}
{"question": "What is the primary recommendation regarding the use of `persist` after Spark automatically persists data during a shuffle?", "answer": "We still recommend users call `persist` on the resulting RDD if they plan to reuse it, even though Spark automatically persists some intermediate data during shuffle operations."}
{"question": "According to the text, what should you do if your RDDs comfortably fit with the default storage level?", "answer": "If your RDDs fit comfortably with the default storage level (`MEMORY_ONLY`), you should leave them that way, as this is the most CPU-efficient option."}
{"question": "When is it advisable to use `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` and a fast serialization library?", "answer": "It's advisable to use `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` and a fast serialization library when RDDs do not fit comfortably with the default storage level, to make the objects more space-efficient while still maintaining reasonably fast access."}

{"question": "What does the `RDD.unpersist()` method do?", "answer": "The `RDD.unpersist()` method manually removes an RDD instead of waiting for it to fall out of the cache, freeing up resources."}
{"question": "What is the typical behavior of variables used in functions passed to Spark operations?", "answer": "Normally, when a function passed to a Spark operation is executed on a remote cluster node, it works on separate copies of all the variables used in the function."}
{"question": "What are broadcast variables used for in Spark?", "answer": "Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a read-only variable cached on each machine rather than shipping a copy of it with tasks, making it efficient to provide every node with a copy of a large input dataset."}
{"question": "How does Spark handle common data needed by tasks within each stage?", "answer": "Spark automatically broadcasts the common data needed by tasks within each stage, caching it in serialized form and deserializing it before running each task."}
{"question": "When is it beneficial to explicitly create broadcast variables instead of relying on Spark's automatic broadcasting?", "answer": "Explicitly creating broadcast variables is useful when tasks across multiple stages need the same data or when caching the data in deserialized form is important."}
{"question": "How are broadcast variables accessed within Spark code?", "answer": "Broadcast variables are accessed by calling the `value` method on the broadcast variable object, which provides access to the cached data."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of accumulators in Spark?", "answer": "Accumulators are variables that are only “added” to through an associative and commutative operation, allowing for efficient parallel updates and are used to implement counters or sums."}
{"question": "How can you track the progress of accumulators in the Spark web UI?", "answer": "Spark displays the value for each accumulator modified by a task in the “Tasks” table within the web UI, which can be useful for understanding the progress of running stages (though this is not yet supported in Python)."}
{"question": "How is an accumulator created in Spark?", "answer": "An accumulator is created from an initial value `v` by calling `SparkContext.accumulator(v)`."}
{"question": "What is the role of the `AccumulatorParam` interface when creating custom accumulator types?", "answer": "The `AccumulatorParam` interface has two methods, `zero` for providing a “zero value” for your data type, and `addInPlace` for adding two values together, allowing programmers to define how custom accumulator types are initialized and updated."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `doubleAccumulator()` and `longAccumulator()` methods in SparkContext?", "answer": "The `doubleAccumulator()` and `longAccumulator()` methods in SparkContext are used to accumulate values of type Double or Long, respectively, allowing tasks running on a cluster to add to the accumulator, while only the driver program can read its value using the `value` method."}
{"question": "How is an accumulator used in Scala to add up the elements of an array?", "answer": "In Scala, an accumulator is first created using `sc.longAccumulator(\"My Accumulator\")`. Then, the array is parallelized and each element is added to the accumulator using `foreach(x => accum.add(x))`. Finally, the driver program can retrieve the accumulated value using `accum.value`."}
{"question": "What must programmers override when creating their own accumulator types by subclassing `AccumulatorV2`?", "answer": "Programmers must override the `reset` method for resetting the accumulator to zero, the `add` method for adding another value, and the `merge` method for merging another same-type accumulator into the current one, along with other methods detailed in the API documentation."}
{"question": "What is the key difference between how accumulators are updated in actions versus transformations in Spark?", "answer": "Accumulator updates performed inside actions are guaranteed to be applied only once, even if tasks are restarted, while updates in transformations may be applied more than once if tasks or job stages are re-executed."}

{"question": "What are the benefits of using Kryo serialization compared to Java serialization in Spark?", "answer": "Kryo serialization is significantly faster and more compact than Java serialization, often achieving speeds up to 10 times faster, but it requires users to register the classes they’ll use in the program in advance for best performance and does not support all Serializable types."}
{"question": "How can you enable Kryo serialization in a Spark job?", "answer": "You can switch to using Kryo by initializing your job with a SparkConf and calling conf.set(\"spark.serializer\", \"org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer\") to configure the serializer used for shuffling data and serializing RDDs to disk."}
{"question": "Since when has Spark internally used Kryo serialization for shuffling RDDs with simple types?", "answer": "Since Spark 2.0.0, the Kryo serializer has been internally used when shuffling RDDs with simple types, arrays of simple types, or string types."}
{"question": "How can you register custom classes with Kryo serialization?", "answer": "To register your own custom classes with Kryo, you should use the registerKryoClasses method, providing an array of class objects like this: conf.registerKryoClasses(Array(classOf[MyClass1], classOf[MyClass2]))"}
{"question": "What should you do if Kryo serialization is still using too much memory for large objects?", "answer": "If your objects are large, you may also need to increase the spark.kryoserializer.buffer config to ensure it is large enough to hold the largest object you will serialize."}
{"question": "What happens if you don't register your custom classes with Kryo?", "answer": "If you don’t register your custom classes, Kryo will still work, but it will have to store the full class name with each object, which is wasteful of space."}
{"question": "What are the three main considerations when tuning memory usage in Spark?", "answer": "The three considerations in tuning memory usage are the amount of memory used by your objects, the cost of accessing those objects, and the overhead of garbage collection."}
{"question": "How much overhead can Java objects have compared to their raw data?", "answer": "Java objects can easily consume a factor of 2-5x more space than the “raw” data inside their fields due to features like the object header and internal data structures."}
{"question": "What is the approximate overhead of a Java String object?", "answer": "Java Strings have about 40 bytes of overhead over the raw string data, as they store characters as an array of Chars and keep extra data such as the length, and store each character as two bytes due to UTF-16 encoding."}
{"question": "How do linked data structures like HashMap and LinkedList affect memory usage?", "answer": "Linked data structures use a “wrapper” object for each entry (e.g., Map.Entry), which not only has a header but also pointers, typically 8 bytes each, to the next object in the list, increasing memory consumption."}
{"question": "What are the two main categories of memory usage in Spark?", "answer": "Memory usage in Spark largely falls under one of two categories: execution memory, used for computation in shuffles, joins, sorts and aggregations, and storage memory, used for caching and propagating internal data across the cluster."}
{"question": "How do execution and storage memory interact in Spark?", "answer": "Execution and storage memory share a unified region (M), and when one isn't using memory, the other can acquire it; execution may evict storage if necessary, but only until total storage memory usage falls under a certain threshold (R)."}
{"question": "What does the spark.memory.fraction configuration control?", "answer": "The spark.memory.fraction configuration expresses the size of M (the unified memory region) as a fraction of the (JVM heap space - 300MiB), with a default value of 0.6."}
{"question": "How can you determine the memory consumption of an RDD?", "answer": "The best way to determine the memory consumption of a dataset is to create an RDD, put it into cache, and look at the “Storage” page in the Spark web UI, which will tell you how much memory the RDD is occupying."}
{"question": "What is the SizeEstimator used for?", "answer": "The SizeEstimator’s estimate method is useful for experimenting with different data layouts to trim memory usage, as well as determining the amount of space a broadcast variable will occupy on each executor heap."}
{"question": "What is one way to reduce memory consumption by changing your data structures?", "answer": "One way to reduce memory consumption is to design your data structures to prefer arrays of objects and primitive types instead of the standard Java or Scala collection classes."}
{"question": "What does the JVM flag -XX:+UseCompressedOops do?", "answer": "-XX:+UseCompressedOops makes pointers be four bytes instead of eight, which can reduce memory usage, and can be added in spark-env.sh if you have less than 32 GiB of RAM."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of storing RDDs in serialized form?", "answer": "Storing RDDs in serialized form, using StorageLevels like MEMORY_ONLY_SER, reduces memory usage by storing each RDD partition as one large byte array."}
{"question": "Why is Kryo recommended when storing data in serialized form?", "answer": "Kryo is highly recommended when storing data in serialized form because it leads to much smaller sizes than Java serialization and certainly than raw Java objects."}
{"question": "When might JVM garbage collection become a problem in Spark?", "answer": "JVM garbage collection can be a problem when you have large “churn” in terms of the RDDs stored by your program, meaning frequent object creation and destruction."}
{"question": "According to the text, what is the relationship between the number of Java objects and the cost of garbage collection?", "answer": "The cost of garbage collection is proportional to the number of Java objects, meaning that using data structures with fewer objects can greatly lower this cost."}
{"question": "What is the first thing the text suggests trying if garbage collection (GC) is a problem?", "answer": "The first thing to try if GC is a problem is to use serialized caching."}
{"question": "How can interference between tasks’ working memory and cached RDDs cause problems with garbage collection?", "answer": "GC can be a problem due to interference between your tasks’ working memory and the RDDs cached on your nodes, and this can be mitigated by controlling the space allocated to the RDD cache."}
{"question": "What Java options can be added to collect statistics on garbage collection frequency and time spent in GC?", "answer": "To collect statistics on how frequently garbage collection occurs and the amount of time spent in GC, you can add -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps to the Java options."}
{"question": "Where can you find the garbage collection logs printed when using the specified Java options?", "answer": "The garbage collection logs will be found on your cluster’s worker nodes in the stdout files in their work directories, not on your driver program."}
{"question": "What are the two main regions into which Java Heap space is divided?", "answer": "Java Heap space is divided into two regions: Young and Old."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Young generation in Java memory management?", "answer": "The Young generation is meant to hold short-lived objects."}
{"question": "Describe the simplified process of a minor GC in the Young generation.", "answer": "When Eden is full, a minor GC is run on Eden and objects that are alive from Eden and Survivor1 are copied to Survivor2, and the Survivor regions are then swapped."}
{"question": "What is the primary goal of GC tuning in Spark?", "answer": "The goal of GC tuning in Spark is to ensure that only long-lived RDDs are stored in the Old generation and that the Young generation is sufficiently sized to store short-lived objects."}
{"question": "What does the text suggest doing if a full GC is invoked multiple times before a task completes?", "answer": "If a full GC is invoked multiple times before a task completes, it means that there isn’t enough memory available for executing tasks."}
{"question": "If there are too many minor collections but not many major GCs, what does the text suggest?", "answer": "If there are too many minor collections but not many major GCs, allocating more memory for Eden would help."}
{"question": "How can the size of the Young generation be set, given the size of Eden (E)?", "answer": "The size of the Young generation can be set using the option -Xmn=4/3*E, with the scaling up by 4/3 to account for space used by survivor regions."}
{"question": "What should you do if the OldGen is close to being full, according to the text?", "answer": "If the OldGen is close to being full, you should reduce the amount of memory used for caching by lowering spark.memory.fraction."}
{"question": "What is the default garbage collector used by Spark since version 4.0.0?", "answer": "Since 4.0.0, Spark uses JDK 17 by default, which also makes the G1GC garbage collector the default."}
{"question": "What adjustment might be important to make with large executor heap sizes?", "answer": "With large executor heap sizes, it may be important to increase the G1 region size with -XX:G1HeapRegionSize."}
{"question": "How can you estimate the size of Eden when reading data from HDFS?", "answer": "The size of Eden can be estimated by considering the size of the data block read from HDFS, accounting for decompression, and multiplying by the desired number of tasks’ worth of working space, for example, 4*3*128MiB."}
{"question": "What is recommended regarding monitoring garbage collection after making new settings?", "answer": "You should monitor how the frequency and time taken by garbage collection changes with the new settings."}
{"question": "How can you specify GC tuning flags for executors in Spark?", "answer": "GC tuning flags for executors can be specified by setting spark.executor.defaultJavaOptions or spark.executor.extraJavaOptions in a job’s configuration."}
{"question": "What is recommended regarding the level of parallelism for each operation?", "answer": "Clusters will not be fully utilized unless you set the level of parallelism for each operation high enough."}
{"question": "How does Spark automatically set the number of map tasks?", "answer": "Spark automatically sets the number of “map” tasks to run on each file according to its size."}
{"question": "According to the text, what are the different levels of data locality in Spark, listed from closest to farthest?", "answer": "The levels of data locality in Spark, from closest to farthest, are PROCESS_LOCAL, NODE_LOCAL, NO_PREF, RACK_LOCAL, and ANY."}
{"question": "What happens when there is no unprocessed data on any idle executor in Spark?", "answer": "When there is no unprocessed data on any idle executor, Spark switches to lower locality levels, either waiting for a busy CPU to free up or immediately starting a new task in a farther away place that requires moving data."}
{"question": "How does Spark typically handle the situation when it needs to move data from a distant location to a free CPU?", "answer": "Spark typically waits a bit in the hopes that a busy CPU frees up, and once that timeout expires, it starts moving the data from far away to the free CPU."}
{"question": "What is the primary focus of the guide discussed in the provided text regarding Spark application tuning?", "answer": "The primary focus of the guide is data serialization and memory tuning, with a recommendation to switch to Kryo serialization and persist data in serialized form to solve most common performance issues."}
{"question": "What is the primary concern regarding Spark security highlighted in the text?", "answer": "The primary concern regarding Spark security is that security features like authentication are not enabled by default, and it's important to secure access to the cluster when deploying it to an untrusted network."}
{"question": "According to the text, what does Spark currently support for authentication of RPC channels?", "answer": "Spark currently supports authentication for RPC channels using a shared secret, which can be turned on by setting the spark.authenticate configuration parameter."}
{"question": "How does Spark handle authentication secrets when running on YARN?", "answer": "For Spark on YARN, Spark will automatically handle generating and distributing a unique shared secret for each application, relying on YARN RPC encryption for secure distribution."}
{"question": "What does setting `spark.authenticate` to `true` accomplish?", "answer": "Setting `spark.authenticate` to `true` enables Spark to authenticate its internal connections."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `spark.authenticate.secret.file` configuration parameter?", "answer": "The `spark.authenticate.secret.file` parameter specifies the path to a file containing the secret key used for authentication, allowing Spark to load the secret from a file instead of relying on a configuration option."}
{"question": "What is the preferred method for encrypting RPC connections in Spark?", "answer": "The preferred method for encrypting RPC connections in Spark is TLS (aka SSL) encryption."}
{"question": "What are the two primary methods for encrypting RPC connections in Spark, and which is generally recommended?", "answer": "Spark supports SSL-based encryption and AES-based encryption for RPC connections. SSL is standardized and considered more secure, making it the preferred method, while the AES-based encryption is a legacy option that may be simpler to configure if only data encryption in transit is required."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `spark.network.crypto.authEngineVersion` property, and what are the recommended settings?", "answer": "The `spark.network.crypto.authEngineVersion` property configures the version of AES-based RPC encryption to use, with valid options being 1 or 2. Version 2 is recommended for better security properties as it applies a key derivation function (KDF) to ensure a uniformly distributed session key."}
{"question": "How does Spark handle the situation when both SSL and AES-based encryption are enabled in the configuration?", "answer": "If both SSL-based and AES-based encryption are enabled, the SSL-based RPC encryption takes precedence, and the AES-based encryption will not be used; a warning message will also be emitted to indicate this behavior."}
{"question": "What is the key difference between the RPC and UI implementations of SSL in Spark?", "answer": "The RPC implementation of SSL uses Netty under the hood, which supports a different set of options compared to the UI implementation that uses Jetty. Additionally, RPC SSL is not automatically enabled when `spark.ssl.enabled` is set, requiring explicit enablement for a safe migration path."}
{"question": "What is required in addition to enabling AES-based encryption for RPC connections?", "answer": "For AES-based encryption to be enabled, RPC authentication must also be enabled and properly configured, as it relies on this authentication mechanism."}
{"question": "What does the `spark.io.encryption.enabled` property control, and what is a strong recommendation when using it?", "answer": "The `spark.io.encryption.enabled` property enables local disk I/O encryption for temporary data like shuffle files and data blocks. It is strongly recommended that RPC encryption also be enabled when using this feature."}
{"question": "How are access control lists (ACLs) configured for the Spark Web UI?", "answer": "ACLs can be configured for either users or groups, accepting comma-separated lists as input to grant view or modify permissions to the application's UI.

{"question": "According to the text, what happens if a query is run in Update output mode and the data is late beyond the watermark?", "answer": "If a query is run in Update output mode, the engine will keep updating counts of a window in the Result Table until the window is older than the watermark, which lags behind the current event time by 10 minutes."}
{"question": "How does the engine determine the watermark in relation to the maximum event time?", "answer": "The watermark is set as (max event time - '10 mins') at the beginning of every trigger, effectively lagging behind the current event time by 10 minutes."}
{"question": "What happens to intermediate state for a window when the watermark is updated to 12:11?", "answer": "When the watermark is updated to 12:11, the intermediate state for window (12:00 - 12:10) is cleared, and all subsequent data is considered “too late” and therefore ignored."}
{"question": "What is the difference between Update Mode and Append Mode in terms of how data is written to the sink?", "answer": "In Update Mode, the engine keeps updating counts of a window to the sink, while in Append Mode, only the final counts are written to the sink."}
{"question": "What happens if you attempt to use `withWatermark` on a non-streaming Dataset?", "answer": "Using `withWatermark` on a non-streaming Dataset is a no-op, meaning it is ignored because the watermark should not affect any batch query."}
{"question": "How do tumbling and sliding windows differ?", "answer": "Tumbling windows are a series of fixed-sized, non-overlapping intervals, while sliding windows are also fixed-sized but can overlap if the slide duration is smaller than the window duration."}

{"question": "What are the required output modes for aggregation queries to utilize watermarking for cleaning state?", "answer": "The required output modes are Append or Update, as Complete mode preserves all aggregate data and cannot use watermarking to drop intermediate state."}
{"question": "What conditions must be met for watermarking to effectively clean state in aggregation queries?", "answer": "The aggregation must have either the event-time column, or a window on the event-time column, and `withWatermark` must be called on the same column as the timestamp column used in the aggregate, and before the aggregation itself."}
{"question": "What is the implication of a watermark delay of \"2 hours\" in the context of aggregation?", "answer": "A watermark delay of \"2 hours\" guarantees that the engine will not drop any data that is less than 2 hours delayed, meaning any data within 2 hours of the latest processed data is guaranteed to be aggregated."}
{"question": "What is the primary challenge when performing stream-stream joins?", "answer": "The primary challenge is that at any point in time, the view of the dataset is incomplete for both sides of the join, making it harder to find matches between inputs."}
{"question": "What types of joins are supported between a streaming and a static DataFrame/Dataset?", "answer": "Structured Streaming supports inner joins and some types of outer joins between a streaming and a static DataFrame/Dataset."}
{"question": "According to the text, why is it necessary to buffer past input as streaming state when performing stream-stream joins?", "answer": "The text explains that buffering past input as streaming state is necessary to match every future input with past input and accordingly generate joined results for both input streams."}
{"question": "What is a key difference between how inner joins and outer joins handle watermarks and event-time constraints?", "answer": "The text states that while watermarks and event-time constraints are optional for inner joins, they *must* be specified for outer joins because the engine needs to know when an input row will not match with anything in the future to generate NULL results correctly."}
{"question": "What potential issue can arise regarding the timeliness of outer join results in the current micro-batch engine implementation?", "answer": "The text explains that the generation of outer join results may be delayed if neither of the two input streams receives new data for a while, as watermarks are advanced at the end of each micro-batch and a new micro-batch is only triggered when new data arrives."}
{"question": "Why are watermark + event-time constraints required for semi joins?", "answer": "Watermark + event-time constraints are required for semi joins to allow the engine to evict unmatched input rows on the left side, ensuring it knows when a row on the left side will not match anything on the right side in the future."}
{"question": "How can you define a constraint on event-time across two inputs during a stream-stream join?", "answer": "A constraint on event-time across two inputs can be defined in one of two ways: using time range join conditions (e.g., `JOIN ON leftTime BETWEEN rightTime AND rightTime + INTERVAL 1 HOUR`) or by joining on event-time windows (e.g., `JOIN ON leftTimeWindow = rightTimeWindow`)."}
{"question": "In the ad-monetization example, what watermark delays and event-time range condition were specified?", "answer": "In the ad-monetization example, the watermark delays were set to 2 hours for impressions and 3 hours for clicks, and the event-time range condition specified that a click could occur within 0 seconds to 1 hour after the corresponding impression."}
{"question": "What does a watermark delay of '2 hours' guarantee regarding data processing?", "answer": "A watermark delay of '2 hours' guarantees that the engine will never drop any data that is less than 2 hours delayed, but data delayed by more than 2 hours may or may not get processed."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of defining additional join conditions to avoid unbounded state growth in stream-stream joins?", "answer": "Defining additional join conditions ensures that indefinitely old inputs cannot match with future inputs, allowing them to be cleared from the state and preventing unbounded state growth as the stream runs."}
{"question": "How is the join condition expressed in the provided code examples?", "answer": "The join condition is expressed using `expr` and includes checks for matching IDs and ensuring the click time falls within a specified time range after the impression time, such as `clickAdId = impressionAdId AND clickTime >= impressionTime AND clickTime <= impressionTime + interval 1 hour`."}
{"question": "What are the possible values for the `joinType` parameter when performing a join?", "answer": "The `joinType` parameter can be set to one of the following values: \"inner\", \"leftOuter\", \"rightOuter\", \"fullOuter\", or \"leftSemi\"."}
{"question": "What is a semi join, and how does it differ from other join types?", "answer": "A semi join, also referred to as a left semi join, returns values from the left side of the relation that have a match with the right side, and it requires watermark + event-time constraints to evict unmatched input rows on the left side."}
{"question": "What is the primary concern regarding the generation of outer NULL results?", "answer": "The primary concern is that the outer NULL results will be generated with a delay that depends on the specified watermark delay and the time range condition, as the engine must wait to ensure there are no future matches."}
{"question": "What is the significance of specifying a watermark delay?", "answer": "Specifying a watermark delay ensures that the engine will never drop any data that is less than the specified delay, although data exceeding the delay may or may not be processed."}
{"question": "How does the micro-batch engine affect the timeliness of outer join results?", "answer": "Because the micro-batch engine advances watermarks at the end of a micro-batch and only triggers a new batch when new data arrives, the generation of outer join results can be delayed if either input stream stops receiving data."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using watermarks in streaming aggregations and stream-stream joins?", "answer": "Watermarks are used to automatically handle late, out-of-order data and to limit the state size by allowing the engine to discard data that is considered too old to be relevant for future matches or aggregations."}
{"question": "According to the text, what guarantees do semi-joins offer regarding watermark delays and data loss?", "answer": "Semi joins have the same guarantees as inner joins regarding watermark delays and whether data will be dropped or not."}
{"question": "What is the support status of a stream-to-static inner join in streaming queries?", "answer": "A stream-to-static inner join is supported, but it is not stateful."}
{"question": "What is required when performing a stream-to-stream inner join to enable state cleanup?", "answer": "When performing a stream-to-stream inner join, you must optionally specify a watermark on both sides and time constraints for state cleanup."}
{"question": "What conditions must be met to correctly support a stream-to-stream right outer join?", "answer": "To correctly support a stream-to-stream right outer join, you must specify a watermark on the left side and time constraints for correct results, optionally specifying a watermark on the right side for all state cleanup."}
{"question": "What is required to conditionally support a stream-to-stream full outer join?", "answer": "To conditionally support a stream-to-stream full outer join, you must specify a watermark on one side and time constraints for correct results, optionally specifying a watermark on the other side for all state cleanup."}

{"question": "How can records be deduplicated in data streams?", "answer": "Records can be deduplicated in data streams using a unique identifier in the events, similar to deduplication on static data using a unique identifier column."}
{"question": "What is the difference between deduplication with and without watermarking?", "answer": "With watermarking, the query removes old state data from past records that are not expected to get any duplicates, bounding the amount of state maintained, while without watermarking, the query stores data from all past records as state."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `dropDuplicates` function in the provided code?", "answer": "The `dropDuplicates` function is used to remove duplicate records from a streaming DataFrame, either based on a single column (like 'guid') or multiple columns (like 'guid' and 'eventTime')."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark`?", "answer": "The `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark` function is used to deduplicate records within the time range of a watermark, allowing for the handling of events where event times might differ for the same records."}
{"question": "What is recommended regarding the delay threshold of a watermark when using `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark`?", "answer": "Users are encouraged to set the delay threshold of the watermark longer than the maximum timestamp differences among duplicated events."}
{"question": "How can you deduplicate using a guid column with a watermark based on an eventTime column?", "answer": "You can deduplicate using a guid column with a watermark based on an eventTime column by first applying `withWatermark` to set the watermark and then using `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark` with the guid column."}
{"question": "How can you add a watermark to a streaming DataFrame based on an event time column?", "answer": "You can add a watermark to a streaming DataFrame based on an event time column using the `withWatermark` function, specifying the column name and a delay, such as `streamingDf.withWatermark(\"eventTime\", \"10 hours\")`."}
{"question": "What happens when a streaming query involves multiple input streams with differing tolerances for late data?", "answer": "When a streaming query has multiple input streams with different thresholds for late data, Structured Streaming individually tracks the maximum event time in each stream, calculates watermarks based on their respective delays, and then chooses a single global watermark to use for stateful operations."}
{"question": "By default, how does Structured Streaming choose the global watermark when dealing with multiple input streams?", "answer": "By default, Structured Streaming chooses the minimum of the calculated watermarks as the global watermark to ensure no data is accidentally dropped as too late, even if one of the streams falls behind."}
{"question": "Since Spark 2.4, how can you configure Structured Streaming to use the maximum watermark value as the global watermark?", "answer": "Since Spark 2.4, you can set the SQL configuration `spark.sql.streaming.multipleWatermarkPolicy` to `max` to use the maximum watermark value as the global watermark, potentially allowing for faster results but also increasing the risk of dropping data from slower streams."}
{"question": "What operators can be used for more advanced stateful operations beyond aggregations, introduced since Spark 2.2?", "answer": "Since Spark 2.2, the `mapGroupsWithState` and `flatMapGroupsWithState` operators can be used for more advanced stateful operations, allowing user-defined code to be applied to grouped Datasets to update user-defined state."}
{"question": "What is the recommended operator for building complex stateful applications in Spark 4.0 and later?", "answer": "Since the Spark 4.0 release, users are encouraged to use the new `transformWithState` operator to build their complex stateful applications."}
{"question": "What should be considered when implementing the state function in Update mode?", "answer": "In Update mode, the state function should not emit rows that are older than the current watermark plus the allowed late record delay."}
{"question": "What DataFrame/Dataset operations are not supported with streaming DataFrames/Datasets?", "answer": "Operations like `limit`, `take`, `distinct`, and sorting (except after aggregation in Complete Output Mode) are not supported with streaming DataFrames/Datasets."}
{"question": "What is a workaround for chaining multiple stateful operations on streaming DataFrames/Datasets in Update or Complete mode?", "answer": "A workaround is to split your streaming query into multiple queries, each having a single stateful operation, and ensure end-to-end exactly once processing per query."}
{"question": "What does the `count()` method return when used on a streaming Dataset, and what is the recommended alternative?", "answer": "The `count()` method cannot return a single count from a streaming Dataset; instead, you should use `ds.groupBy().count()`, which returns a streaming Dataset containing a running count."}
{"question": "What happens if you attempt to use an unsupported operation on a streaming DataFrame/Dataset?", "answer": "If you try to use an unsupported operation on a streaming DataFrame/Dataset, you will receive an `AnalysisException` indicating that the operation is not supported."}
{"question": "Why is sorting on the input stream not supported in Structured Streaming?", "answer": "Sorting on the input stream is not supported because it requires keeping track of all the data received in the stream, which is fundamentally hard to execute efficiently."}
{"question": "What is a state store in Structured Streaming, and what is its purpose?", "answer": "A state store is a versioned key-value store that provides both read and write operations, and in Structured Streaming, it's used to handle stateful operations across batches."}
{"question": "What is the default state store provider implementation in Structured Streaming?", "answer": "The HDFS backend state store provider is the default implementation of `StateStoreProvider` in Structured Streaming, storing all data in memory map initially and then backing it up with files in an HDFS-compatible file system."}
{"question": "What issues might arise when maintaining millions of keys in the state of a streaming query, and how can RocksDB help?", "answer": "Maintaining millions of keys in the state can lead to large JVM garbage collection (GC) pauses, causing high variations in micro-batch processing times; RocksDB provides a more optimized solution by managing state in native memory and local disk instead of the JVM memory."}

{"question": "How did Spark handle inferred schemas in releases 2.2.0 and 2.1.x, and what was the consequence of this behavior?", "answer": "In 2.2.0 and 2.1.x releases, the inferred schema was partitioned, but the data of the table was invisible to users, meaning the result set was empty."}
{"question": "What issue might arise when upgrading Spark and attempting to read views created by older versions, and how can it be resolved?", "answer": "Upgrading Spark can cause issues reading views created by prior versions because view definitions are stored differently; in such cases, you need to recreate the views using `ALTER VIEW AS` or `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW AS` with newer Spark versions."}
{"question": "What change was introduced regarding partition metadata storage in Hive metastore when upgrading from Spark SQL 2.0 to 2.1?", "answer": "When upgrading from Spark SQL 2.0 to 2.1, datasource tables began storing partition metadata in the Hive metastore, enabling the use of Hive DDLs like `ALTER TABLE PARTITION ... SET LOCATION` for tables created with the Datasource API."}
{"question": "How can you determine if a table has been migrated to the new format for storing partition metadata in the Hive metastore?", "answer": "To determine if a table has been migrated, you can look for the `PartitionProvider: Catalog` attribute when issuing `DESCRIBE FORMATTED` on the table."}
{"question": "How did the behavior of `INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE ... PARTITION ...` change for Datasource tables after upgrading from prior Spark versions?", "answer": "In prior Spark versions, `INSERT OVERWRITE` overwrote the entire Datasource table, even with a partition specification, but now only partitions matching the specification are overwritten."}
{"question": "What is the new entry point for Spark, replacing the old `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`, and are the older contexts still available?", "answer": "The `SparkSession` is now the new entry point of Spark, replacing the old `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`; however, the old `SQLContext` and `HiveContext` are kept for backward compatibility."}
{"question": "What changes were made to the Dataset and DataFrame APIs during the upgrade process?", "answer": "The Dataset API and DataFrame API were unified, with `DataFrame` becoming a type alias for `Dataset[Row]` in Scala, and Java API users needing to replace `DataFrame` with `Dataset<Row>`, along with deprecations of `unionAll`, `explode`, and `registerTempTable`."}
{"question": "How has the behavior of `CREATE TABLE ... LOCATION` changed in Spark 2.0, and what is the implication of this change?", "answer": "From Spark 2.0, `CREATE TABLE ... LOCATION` is now equivalent to `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ... LOCATION` to prevent accidental dropping of existing data in the user-provided locations, meaning tables created with a user-specified location are always Hive external tables."}
{"question": "What is the effect of dropping an external table created with a user-specified location?", "answer": "Dropping external tables will not remove the data, as they are designed to keep the data separate from the table metadata."}
{"question": "What happened to `spark.sql.parquet.cacheMetadata` in newer Spark versions?", "answer": "`spark.sql.parquet.cacheMetadata` is no longer used in newer Spark versions."}
{"question": "What change was introduced to the Thrift server's session mode in Spark 1.6, and how can the old behavior be restored?", "answer": "From Spark 1.6, the Thrift server runs in multi-session mode by default, where each JDBC/ODBC connection owns its own SQL configuration and temporary function registry, but this can be reverted to single-session mode by setting `spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.singleSession` to `true`."}
{"question": "What change was made to the behavior of `LongType` casts to `TimestampType` in Spark 1.6, and why?", "answer": "From Spark 1.6, `LongType` casts to `TimestampType` expect seconds instead of microseconds to match the behavior of Hive 1.2 for more consistent type casting."}
{"question": "What features were enabled by default in Spark 2.2, and how can they be disabled?", "answer": "Optimized execution using manually managed memory (Tungsten) and code generation for expression evaluation were enabled by default in Spark 2.2, but they can both be disabled by setting `spark.sql.tungsten.enabled` to `false`."}
{"question": "What change was made to Parquet schema merging in Spark 2.2, and how can it be re-enabled?", "answer": "Parquet schema merging was no longer enabled by default in Spark 2.2, but it can be re-enabled by setting `spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema` to `true`."}
{"question": "What changes were made regarding decimal column precision in Spark SQL?", "answer": "Unlimited precision decimal columns are no longer supported, and Spark SQL enforces a maximum precision of 38; when inferring schema from `BigDecimal` objects, a precision of (38, 18) is now used, and the default precision for DDL remains `Decimal(10, 0)`."}
{"question": "How has the parsing of floating-point numbers changed in the SQL dialect?", "answer": "In the SQL dialect, floating-point numbers are now parsed as decimal, while HiveQL parsing remains unchanged."}

{"question": "How does the JSON data source handle new files created by other applications?", "answer": "The JSON data source will not automatically load new files that are created by other applications; for a JSON persistent table, users can use `REFRESH TABLE` or `refreshTable` to include those new files, while for a DataFrame, the DataFrame needs to be recreated."}
{"question": "What new API was introduced for reading and writing data in DataFrames when upgrading from Spark SQL 1.3 to 1.4?", "answer": "A new, more fluid API for reading data in (`SQLContext.read`) and writing data out (`DataFrame.write`) was created, and the old APIs (e.g., `SQLContext.parquetFile`, `SQLContext.jsonFile`) were deprecated."}
{"question": "How did the default behavior of `DataFrame.groupBy().agg()` change, and how can the original behavior be restored?", "answer": "The default behavior of `DataFrame.groupBy().agg()` was changed to retain the grouping columns in the resulting DataFrame, but to keep the behavior from 1.3, you can set `spark.sql.retainGroupColumns` to `false`."}
{"question": "According to the text, how does the behavior of `DataFrame.withColumn()` change between Spark versions 1.3 and 1.4?", "answer": "Prior to Spark 1.4, `DataFrame.withColumn()` always added a new column with the specified name, even if a column with that name already existed, whereas in Spark 1.4 and later, it supports either adding a new column with a different name or replacing an existing column with the same name."}
{"question": "What change occurred regarding the `SchemaRDD` class when upgrading to Spark SQL 1.3?", "answer": "The `SchemaRDD` class was renamed to `DataFrame` in Spark SQL 1.3, as DataFrames no longer directly inherit from RDDs but provide most of the RDD functionality through their own implementation."}
{"question": "In Spark 1.3, how did the Java and Scala APIs change in relation to each other?", "answer": "In Spark 1.3, the Java API and Scala API were unified, and users of either language should use `SQLContext` and `DataFrame` instead of the separate Java-compatible classes like `JavaSQLContext` and `JavaSchemaRDD`."}
{"question": "What change was made to the way implicit conversions are handled in Spark 1.3?", "answer": "In Spark 1.3, implicit conversions for converting RDDs into DataFrames were isolated into an object inside of the `SQLContext`, and users are now required to write `import sqlContext.implicits._` to access them."}
{"question": "How did the location of UDF registration functions change between Spark versions?", "answer": "UDF registration functions were moved into the `udf` object within `SQLContext` in Spark 1.3, so users should now use `sqlContext.udf.register()` instead of the previous method."}
{"question": "What is Spark SQL designed to be compatible with regarding data storage and processing?", "answer": "Spark SQL is designed to be compatible with the Hive Metastore, SerDes, and UDFs, allowing it to connect to different versions of the Hive Metastore and work with existing Hive installations."}
{"question": "What is one important consideration when working with views created by Hive in Spark SQL?", "answer": "If column aliases are not specified in view definition queries, both Spark and Hive will generate alias names differently, and for Spark to be able to read views created by Hive, users should explicitly specify column aliases in view definition queries."}
{"question": "According to the text, what Hive features are currently unsupported in Spark SQL?", "answer": "The text lists several unsupported Hive features, including UNION, type, unique join, column statistics collecting, block-level bitmap indexes, virtual columns, automatically determining the number of reducers for joins and groupbys, meta-data only query, skew data flag, STREAMTABLE hint, and merging multiple small files for query results."}
{"question": "What is the only file format that Spark SQL supports for results shown back to the CLI?", "answer": "Spark SQL only supports TextOutputFormat for the file format when results are shown back to the command-line interface (CLI)."}
{"question": "What is one reason some Hive optimizations are considered less important in Spark SQL?", "answer": "Some Hive optimizations, such as indexes, are less important in Spark SQL due to its in-memory computational model."}
{"question": "How does Spark SQL handle determining the number of reducers for joins and groupbys, compared to Hive?", "answer": "Currently, in Spark SQL, you need to manually control the degree of parallelism post-shuffle using `SET spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=[num_tasks];`, whereas Hive automatically determines the number of reducers."}
{"question": "How does Spark SQL behave when processing queries that should only use metadata?", "answer": "For queries that can be answered using only metadata, Spark SQL still launches tasks to compute the result, unlike Hive which would not."}
{"question": "What happens when Spark SQL encounters a skew data flag in Hive?", "answer": "Spark SQL does not follow the skew data flags in Hive."}
{"question": "What APIs related to Hive UDF/UDTF/UDAF are unsupported by Spark SQL?", "answer": "Spark SQL does not support the `getRequiredJars` and `getRequiredFiles` functions for Hive UDF/UDTF/UDAF, the `initialize(StructObjectInspector)` function in `GenericUDTF`, and the `configure`, `close`, and `reset` functions in `GenericUDF`, `GenericUDTF`, and `GenericUDAFEvaluator`."}
{"question": "How does Spark SQL handle the `SQRT(n)` function when n is negative, compared to Hive?", "answer": "If n is less than 0, Hive returns null, while Spark SQL returns NaN when calculating `SQRT(n)`."}
{"question": "What is the default data source used by Spark SQL for all operations if not otherwise configured?", "answer": "The default data source used by Spark SQL for all operations is `parquet` unless otherwise configured by `spark.sql.sources.default`."}
{"question": "How can you manually specify the data source and extra options when loading data in Spark SQL?", "answer": "You can manually specify the data source by its fully qualified name (e.g., `org.apache.spark.sql.parquet`) or its short name (e.g., `json`, `parquet`, `jdbc`) along with any extra options you want to pass to the data source."}

{"question": "What happens when you use the `Overwrite` save mode?", "answer": "Overwrite mode means that when saving a DataFrame to a data source, if data/table already exists, the existing data is expected to be overwritten by the contents of the DataFrame."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `saveAsTable` command?", "answer": "The `saveAsTable` command materializes the contents of the DataFrame and creates a pointer to the data in the Hive metastore, allowing you to save DataFrames as persistent tables."}
{"question": "What happens if you do not specify a custom table path when using `saveAsTable`?", "answer": "If no custom table path is specified when using `saveAsTable`, Spark will write data to a default table path under the warehouse directory, and this path will be removed when the table is dropped."}
{"question": "What is the default behavior when saving a DataFrame to a data source if data already exists?", "answer": "The default behavior when saving a DataFrame to a data source if data already exists is to throw an exception, which corresponds to `SaveMode.ErrorIfExists` or \"error\"/\"errorifexists\"."}
{"question": "What does the `Append` save mode do?", "answer": "The `Append` save mode adds the contents of the DataFrame to existing data if the data/table already exists."}

{"question": "What potential drawback exists when using FILESYSTEM recovery mode?", "answer": "Using FILESYSTEM recovery mode may increase the startup time of the Master by up to 1 minute if it needs to wait for all previously-registered Workers/clients to timeout after a restart."}
{"question": "What is the main entry point for all streaming functionality in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "The `StreamingContext` is the main entry point for all streaming functionality in Spark Streaming."}
{"question": "What is the current status of Spark Streaming?", "answer": "Spark Streaming is the previous generation of Spark’s streaming engine and is considered a legacy project with no further updates; Spark Structured Streaming is the newer and recommended streaming engine."}
{"question": "What types of joins are supported by the stream processing framework, and how can joins be performed over windows of streams?", "answer": "The stream processing framework supports `leftOuterJoin`, `rightOuterJoin`, and `fullOuterJoin`.  Joins over windows of streams are easily accomplished by first applying a `window` operation to each stream, creating `windowedStream1` and `windowedStream2`, and then joining these windowed streams using the `join` operation."}
{"question": "How are windowed streams created and subsequently joined in the provided code examples?", "answer": "Windowed streams are created using the `.window()` operation on a stream, specifying a duration (e.g., 20 seconds or 1 minute).  These windowed streams are then joined using the `.join()` operation, resulting in a `joinedStream` containing data from both streams within the specified window durations."}
{"question": "What potential issues can arise when attempting to send records from a DStream to an external system using a connection object created at the driver?", "answer": "Creating a connection object at the driver and attempting to serialize it for use at the worker is incorrect because connection objects are rarely transferable across machines; this can manifest as serialization errors, initialization errors, or other issues indicating the connection object cannot be properly used at the worker node."}
{"question": "Why is creating a new connection object for every record in a DStream inefficient, and what is a better approach?", "answer": "Creating a new connection object for every record incurs significant time and resource overheads, reducing the overall throughput of the system. A better solution is to use `rdd.foreachPartition` to create a single connection object for each RDD partition and send all records within that partition using that connection."}
{"question": "How can connection creation overheads be further optimized when sending data to external systems from a DStream?", "answer": "Connection creation overheads can be further optimized by reusing connection objects across multiple RDDs or batches by maintaining a static pool of connections that are lazily created on demand and timed out if not used for a while, reducing the need to repeatedly establish new connections."}
{"question": "How are DStreams executed, and what must be present for processing to occur?", "answer": "DStreams are executed lazily by output operations, similar to how RDDs are lazily executed by RDD actions.  Processing only occurs if the application has an output operation, and that output operation contains an RDD action; otherwise, the system will receive and discard the data."}
{"question": "How can DataFrames and SQL operations be integrated with streaming data in Spark?", "answer": "You can use DataFrames and SQL operations on streaming data by creating a SparkSession using the SparkContext of the StreamingContext, and it's important to create this SparkSession in a way that allows it to be restarted on driver failures, typically by using a lazily instantiated singleton instance."}
{"question": "In the provided example, how is a SparkSession lazily instantiated for use with streaming data?", "answer": "The SparkSession is lazily instantiated using a function `getSparkSessionInstance` that checks if a global variable `sparkSessionSingletonInstance` exists; if not, it creates a new SparkSession and stores it in the global variable for future reuse, ensuring only one instance is created."}
{"question": "What steps are involved in processing an RDD of strings within a streaming program using DataFrames and SQL?", "answer": "The process involves converting the RDD of strings into an RDD of Rows, then creating a DataFrame from the Row RDD, registering the DataFrame as a temporary view, and finally querying the DataFrame using SQL to perform operations like word counting."}
{"question": "In the provided code snippet, what SQL query is used to perform a word count on the DataFrame named 'words'?", "answer": "The SQL query used to perform a word count on the DataFrame 'words' is \"select word, count(*) as total from words group by word\"."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `JavaRow` class in the context of converting an RDD to a DataFrame?", "answer": "The `JavaRow` class is a Java Bean class used for converting an RDD to a DataFrame, allowing for the representation of each row's data as a Java object with a 'word' attribute."}
{"question": "How does the code convert an RDD of Strings into a DataFrame?", "answer": "The code converts an RDD of Strings into a DataFrame by first mapping each word in the RDD to a `JavaRow` object, setting the 'word' attribute of the `JavaRow` to the string value, and then using the `spark.createDataFrame()` method with the RDD of `JavaRow` objects and the `JavaRow` class as the schema."}
{"question": "After creating the `wordsDataFrame`, what operation is performed to enable SQL queries on it?", "answer": "After creating the `wordsDataFrame`, the `createOrReplaceTempView(\"words\")` operation is performed to create a temporary view, which allows SQL queries to be executed against the DataFrame using the name 'words'."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of `streamingContext.remember(Minutes(5))`?", "answer": "The `streamingContext.remember(Minutes(5))` function ensures that the StreamingContext retains streaming data for 5 minutes, allowing asynchronous SQL queries to complete even if they take longer than the default data retention period."}
{"question": "What is the difference between metadata checkpointing and data checkpointing in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "Metadata checkpointing saves information defining the streaming computation to fault-tolerant storage for driver failure recovery, while data checkpointing saves the generated RDDs to reliable storage, which is necessary for stateful transformations to avoid unbounded recovery time increases."}
{"question": "Under what circumstances is checkpointing required for a Spark Streaming application?", "answer": "Checkpointing is required for applications that use stateful transformations like `updateStateByKey` or `reduceByKeyAndWindow` (with an inverse function), or when recovering from failures of the driver running the application."}
{"question": "What does the `StreamingContext.getOrCreate` method do?", "answer": "The `StreamingContext.getOrCreate` method either recreates a `StreamingContext` from checkpoint data if it exists, or creates a new context using a provided function if the checkpoint directory does not exist."}
{"question": "How is a JavaStreamingContext created or retrieved in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "A JavaStreamingContext can be created or retrieved using the `getOrCreate` method, which either recreates the context from checkpoint data if it exists or creates a new one using a provided context factory if the checkpoint directory does not exist."}
{"question": "What happens if checkpointing is enabled and Accumulators or Broadcast variables are used in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "If checkpointing is enabled and Accumulators or Broadcast variables are used, you’ll have to create lazily instantiated singleton instances for them so that they can be re-instantiated after the driver restarts on failure."}
{"question": "What is the recommended checkpoint interval for stateful transformations in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "For stateful transformations that require RDD checkpointing, the default interval is a multiple of the batch interval that is at least 10 seconds, and a checkpoint interval of 5 - 10 sliding intervals of a DStream is a good setting to try."}
{"question": "What should be done to ensure the driver process is restarted automatically on failure in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "To ensure the driver process gets restarted automatically on failure, the deployment infrastructure used to run the application must be configured to handle restarts, as this functionality is not built into Spark Streaming itself."}
{"question": "How can the rate at which receivers process data be limited in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "Receivers can be rate limited by setting a maximum rate limit in terms of records per second using the configuration parameters `spark.streaming.receiver.maxRate` for receivers and `spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition` for the Direct Kafka approach."}
{"question": "What are the two mechanisms for upgrading an application code in a running Spark Streaming application?", "answer": "A running Spark Streaming application can be upgraded by either starting the upgraded application in parallel to the existing one and switching over once warmed up, or by gracefully shutting down the existing application and then starting the upgraded application."}
{"question": "How does the block interval affect the number of tasks used to process data in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "The number of tasks per receiver per batch will be approximately determined by the batch interval divided by the block interval; reducing the block interval increases the number of tasks, but it's recommended to keep it above 50ms to avoid task launching overheads."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of repartitioning an input data stream in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "Repartitioning an input data stream using `inputStream.repartition(<number of partitions>)` distributes the received batches of data across the specified number of machines in the cluster before further processing."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of write-ahead logs in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "Write-ahead logs are used to ensure that data received by receivers is reliably stored before being processed, providing fault tolerance and allowing recovery of lost data in case of failures."}
{"question": "What is backpressure in Spark Streaming and how is it enabled?", "answer": "Backpressure is a feature in Spark Streaming that automatically figures out and dynamically adjusts rate limits based on processing conditions, eliminating the need for manual rate limit configuration, and it can be enabled by setting the configuration parameter `spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled` to `true`."}
{"question": "According to the text, what configuration property controls the default number of parallel tasks in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "The default number of parallel tasks is controlled by the `spark.default.parallelism` configuration property."}
{"question": "What is the default storage level used for input data received through Receivers in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "Input data received through Receivers is stored in the executors’ memory with `StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2` by default, meaning the data is serialized into bytes to reduce GC overheads and replicated for tolerating executor failures."}
{"question": "How does Spark Streaming handle persisted RDDs generated by streaming operations in terms of GC overheads?", "answer": "Persisted RDDs generated by streaming computations are persisted with `StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY_SER` (i.e. serialized) by default to minimize GC overheads, unlike the Spark Core default of `StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY`."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `spark.locality.wait` parameter in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "A high value of `spark.locality.wait` increases the chance of processing a block on the local node, aiming to improve performance by keeping data processing close to where it's stored."}
{"question": "What happens when the batch processing time exceeds the batch interval in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "If the batch processing time is more than the batch interval, the receiver’s memory will start filling up and will likely throw exceptions, most probably a `BlockNotFoundException`."}
{"question": "What is the difference between 'at least once', 'at most once', and 'exactly once' processing guarantees in a streaming system?", "answer": " 'At least once' guarantees each record will be processed one or more times, 'at most once' guarantees each record will be processed either once or not at all, and 'exactly once' guarantees each record will be processed exactly once without loss or duplication."}
{"question": "According to the text, what guarantees does Spark Streaming provide for transforming the data?", "answer": "All data that has been received will be processed exactly once, thanks to the guarantees that RDDs provide, meaning the final transformed RDDs will always have the same contents even if failures occur."}
{"question": "What is the default fault-tolerance semantic for output operations in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "Output operations by default ensure at-least once semantics because it depends on the type of output operation and the semantics of the downstream system."}
{"question": "What kind of semantics does Spark Streaming provide when processing data already present in a fault-tolerant file system like HDFS?", "answer": "If all of the input data is already present in a fault-tolerant file system like HDFS, Spark Streaming can always recover from any failure and process all of the data, providing exactly-once semantics."}
{"question": "What are the two types of receivers discussed in the text?", "answer": "The two types of receivers discussed in the text are Reliable Receivers and Unreliable Receivers."}
{"question": "According to the text, what happens if a receiver fails to replicate data and then restarts?", "answer": "If the receiver is restarted, the source will resend the data, and no data will be lost due to the failure."}
{"question": "What is a key difference between reliable and unreliable receivers in terms of data loss upon failure?", "answer": "Unreliable receivers do not send acknowledgment and can lose data when they fail, while reliable receivers ensure no data loss with replication."}
{"question": "What type of data loss can occur with reliable receivers if the driver node fails?", "answer": "If the driver node fails, all of the past data that was received and replicated in memory will be lost."}
{"question": "What was introduced in Spark 1.2 to prevent the loss of past received data?", "answer": "Spark 1.2 introduced write-ahead logs, which save the received data to fault-tolerant storage, to avoid the loss of past received data."}
{"question": "What semantics are provided when using write-ahead logs and reliable receivers?", "answer": "With write-ahead logs enabled and reliable receivers, there is zero data loss and an at-least once guarantee."}
{"question": "According to the table, what happens to buffered data with unreliable receivers in the event of a worker failure in Spark 1.1 or earlier?", "answer": "Buffered data is lost with unreliable receivers in Spark 1.1 or earlier during a worker failure."}

{"question": "What is a characteristic of output operations like `foreachRDD`?", "answer": "Output operations like `foreachRDD` have at-least once semantics, meaning the transformed data may get written to an external entity more than once in the event of a worker failure."}
{"question": "What are the two approaches to achieving exactly-once semantics with output operations?", "answer": "The two approaches to achieving exactly-once semantics are idempotent updates and transactional updates."}
{"question": "What is an example of an operation that always writes the same data, making it an idempotent update?", "answer": "The `saveAs***Files` operations always write the same data to the generated files, making it an example of an idempotent update."}
{"question": "How can transactional updates be used to achieve exactly-once semantics?", "answer": "Transactional updates involve making all updates atomically, such as using the batch time and partition index to create an identifier for a blob of data and committing it transactionally."}
{"question": "What file formats does SparkR natively support for reading?", "answer": "SparkR natively supports reading JSON, CSV and Parquet files."}
{"question": "How can data source connectors for file formats like Avro be added to SparkR?", "answer": "Data source connectors can be added by specifying `--packages` with `spark-submit` or `sparkR` commands, or by initializing `SparkSession` with the `sparkPackages` parameter."}
{"question": "What is a requirement for a JSON file to be correctly read by SparkR?", "answer": "Each line in the file must contain a separate, self-contained valid JSON object."}
{"question": "What does SparkR do with the schema of a JSON file when reading it?", "answer": "SparkR automatically infers the schema from the JSON file."}

{"question": "What potential issue arises when attempting to print elements of an RDD using `rdd.foreach(println)` or `rdd.map(println)` in cluster mode?", "answer": "In cluster mode, the output to stdout being called by the executors is written to the executor’s stdout instead of the driver’s stdout, meaning that `stdout` on the driver won’t show the printed elements of the RDD."}
{"question": "What should you use instead of closures to mutate global state in Spark, and why are closures discouraged?", "answer": "Instead of closures, you should use an Accumulator if some global aggregation is needed, because Spark does not define or guarantee the behavior of mutations to objects referenced from outside of closures, and code that does this may only work in local mode by accident."}
{"question": "When working with key-value pairs in Spark, what operation is recommended over `groupByKey` for performance when performing aggregations?", "answer": "When performing aggregations over each key, `reduceByKey` or `aggregateByKey` are recommended over `groupByKey` because they yield much better performance."}
{"question": "What is a crucial consideration when using custom objects as keys in key-value pair operations in Spark?", "answer": "When using custom objects as the key in key-value pair operations, you must ensure that a custom `equals()` method is accompanied by a matching `hashCode()` method, as outlined in the `Object.hashCode()` documentation."}
{"question": "What does the `mapPartitions` transformation do in Spark?", "answer": "The `mapPartitions` transformation runs a function separately on each partition (block) of the RDD, and the function must be of type `Iterator<T> => Iterator<U>` when running on an RDD of type T."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `coalesce` transformation in Spark?", "answer": "The `coalesce` transformation decreases the number of partitions in the RDD to a specified number, and it is useful for running operations more efficiently after filtering down a large dataset."}
{"question": "What does the `repartitionAndSortWithinPartitions` operation do in Spark?", "answer": "The `repartitionAndSortWithinPartitions` operation repartitions the RDD according to a given partitioner and, within each resulting partition, sorts records by their keys, which is more efficient than repartitioning and then sorting within each partition separately."}
{"question": "According to the text, why is sorting within partitions more efficient when combined with repartitioning?", "answer": "Sorting within partitions is more efficient when combined with repartitioning because it can push the sorting down into the shuffle machinery."}
{"question": "What challenge exists when trying to co-locate values for a single key in Spark?", "answer": "The challenge is that not all values for a single key necessarily reside on the same partition, or even the same machine, but they must be co-located to compute the result."}
{"question": "What operation does Spark need to perform to organize data for a `reduceByKey` task to execute?", "answer": "To organize all the data for a single `reduceByKey` reduce task to execute, Spark needs to perform an all-to-all operation, reading from all partitions to find all the values for all keys."}
{"question": "What is the 'shuffle' operation in Spark, and what does it involve?", "answer": "The 'shuffle' is the process where Spark brings together values across partitions to compute the final result for each key; it involves reading from all partitions to find all the values for all keys and then co-locating them."}
{"question": "What are some ways to achieve predictably ordered data following a shuffle operation in Spark?", "answer": "To achieve predictably ordered data following a shuffle, one can use `mapPartitions` to sort each partition, `repartitionAndSortWithinPartitions` to efficiently sort partitions while simultaneously repartitioning, or `sortBy` to make a globally ordered RDD."}
{"question": "What types of operations can cause a shuffle in Spark?", "answer": "Operations that can cause a shuffle include repartition operations like `repartition` and `coalesce`, ‘ByKey’ operations (except for counting) like `groupByKey` and `reduceByKey`, and join operations like `cogroup` and `join`."}
{"question": "Why is the shuffle operation considered an expensive operation in Spark?", "answer": "The shuffle operation is expensive because it involves disk I/O, data serialization, and network I/O."}
{"question": "How are results from individual map tasks handled internally during a shuffle?", "answer": "Internally, results from individual map tasks are kept in memory until they can’t fit, then they are sorted based on the target partition and written to a single file."}
{"question": "Which Spark operations can consume significant amounts of heap memory due to in-memory data structures?", "answer": "Operations like `reduceByKey` and `aggregateByKey` can consume significant amounts of heap memory since they employ in-memory data structures to organize records before or after transferring them."}
{"question": "What happens when data does not fit in memory during shuffle operations like `reduceByKey`?", "answer": "When data does not fit in memory, Spark will spill these tables to disk, incurring the additional overhead of disk I/O and increased garbage collection."}
{"question": "What is done with the intermediate files generated during a shuffle, and why?", "answer": "As of Spark 1.3, these intermediate files are preserved until the corresponding RDDs are no longer used and are garbage collected, so the shuffle files don’t need to be re-created if the lineage is re-computed."}
{"question": "What configuration parameter specifies the temporary storage directory used during shuffle operations?", "answer": "The temporary storage directory is specified by the `spark.local.dir` configuration parameter when configuring the Spark context."}
{"question": "What is RDD persistence in Spark, and why is it important?", "answer": "RDD persistence (or caching) is a capability in Spark that allows storing a dataset in memory across operations, enabling future actions to be much faster, especially for iterative algorithms and fast interactive use."}
{"question": "How can an RDD be marked for persistence, and what does the `cache()` method do?", "answer": "An RDD can be marked for persistence using the `persist()` or `cache()` methods; the `cache()` method is a shorthand for using the default storage level, `StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY`."}

{"question": "Why is it more efficient to keep a state store provider running in the same executor across different streaming batches?", "answer": "It is more efficient to keep a state store provider running in the same executor across different streaming batches because changing the location of a state store provider requires the extra overhead of loading checkpointed states."}
{"question": "How does the size of the state impact the overhead of loading state from checkpoints?", "answer": "The overhead of loading state from checkpoint depends on the external storage and the size of the state, and larger state sizes tend to hurt the latency of micro-batch runs."}
{"question": "How does Structured Streaming attempt to optimize state store provider location?", "answer": "The stateful operations in Structured Streaming queries rely on the preferred location feature of Spark’s RDD to run the state store provider on the same executor."}
{"question": "What happens if Spark schedules a state store provider to an executor other than its preferred location?", "answer": "If Spark schedules a state store provider to an executor other than the preferred one, it will load state store providers from checkpointed states on the new executor."}
{"question": "What happens to state store providers running in the previous batch when a new batch is scheduled?", "answer": "The state store providers running in the previous batch will not be unloaded immediately; Spark runs a maintenance task which checks and unloads the state stores."}
{"question": "What options are available when using the console sink for debugging?", "answer": "When using the console sink, you can specify the `numRows` option to control the number of rows printed every trigger (defaulting to 20), and the `truncate` option to control whether the output is truncated if it's too long (defaulting to true)."}

{"question": "What happens when a StreamingContext is stopped?", "answer": "Once a StreamingContext has been stopped, it cannot be restarted, and stopping a StreamingContext also stops the associated SparkContext."}
{"question": "What happens if a wildcard is used to identify directories being monitored for changes?", "answer": "If a wildcard is used to identify directories, renaming an entire directory to match the path will add the directory to the list of monitored directories."}
{"question": "What can be done to ensure changes to a file are picked up in a window when using 'full' filesystems like HDFS?", "answer": "To guarantee that changes are picked up in a window, write the file to an unmonitored directory, then immediately after the output stream is closed, rename it into the destination directory."}
{"question": "How do Object Stores like Amazon S3 and Azure Storage differ from 'full' filesystems regarding rename operations?", "answer": "Object Stores such as Amazon S3 and Azure Storage usually have slow rename operations, as the data is actually copied, and the rename operation's time may become the file's modification time."}
{"question": "What can happen if a file is included in a DStream before all data is written to it?", "answer": "If a file is included in the DStream before all data has been completely written, updates to the file within the same window will be ignored, potentially causing changes to be missed and data omitted from the stream."}

{"question": "How can a DStream be created for testing a Spark Streaming application?", "answer": "One can create a DStream based on a queue of RDDs, using streamingContext.queueStream(queueOfRDDs), where each RDD pushed into the queue will be treated as a batch of data."}
{"question": "What are the two steps required to maintain arbitrary state while continuously updating it with new information in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "To use stateful stream processing, you must first define the state and then define the state update function, specifying how to update the state using the previous state and new values from an input stream."}
{"question": "What happens in every batch when using stateful stream processing in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "In every batch, Spark will apply the state update function for all existing keys, regardless of whether they have new data in a batch or not, and if the update function returns None, the key-value pair will be eliminated."}
{"question": "In the example provided, what does the running count represent in the context of maintaining state?", "answer": "In the example, the running count is the state and it is an integer, representing a running total of each word seen in a text data stream."}
{"question": "How is the `updateFunction` applied to a DStream containing word pairs?", "answer": "The `updateFunction` is applied on a DStream containing words, specifically pairs containing (word, 1) pairs, using the `updateStateByKey` operation."}
{"question": "What does the `updateStateByKey` operation do with the `newValues` and `runningCount`?", "answer": "The update function will be called for each word, with `newValues` having a sequence of 1’s (from the (word, 1) pairs) and the `runningCount` having the previous count."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `updateFunction` in the Scala example?", "answer": "The `updateFunction` is used to add the new values with the previous running count to get the new count, and it returns an `Option[Int]` representing the updated count."}

{"question": "What is the benefit of using `foreachPartition` over `foreach` when processing records in a DStream?", "answer": "Using `foreachPartition` avoids the overhead of creating and destroying a connection object for each individual record, as it creates a single connection for each partition."}
{"question": "What does the `sendPartition` function do in the provided code?", "answer": "The `sendPartition` function creates a new connection, iterates through the records in a partition, sends each record using the connection, and then closes the connection."}
{"question": "How is the `sendPartition` function applied to the DStream?", "answer": "The `sendPartition` function is applied to the DStream using `dstream.foreachRDD(lambda rdd: rdd.foreachPartition(sendPartition))`."}
{"question": "How does `foreachPartition` help optimize connection creation overhead when processing records?", "answer": "The `foreachPartition` function amortizes the connection creation overheads over many records by creating a connection once per partition and then using that connection to send multiple records, rather than creating a new connection for each individual record."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of reusing connection objects across multiple RDDs or batches?", "answer": "Reusing connection objects across multiple RDDs or batches further reduces overheads by maintaining a static pool of connections that can be reused as RDDs of multiple batches are pushed to the external system."}
{"question": "How does the `ConnectionPool` facilitate efficient data sending in the `sendPartition` function?", "answer": "The `ConnectionPool` is a static, lazily initialized pool of connections; the `sendPartition` function retrieves a connection from the pool, sends each record using that connection, and then returns the connection to the pool for future reuse."}
{"question": "How are DStreams executed, and what forces their processing?", "answer": "DStreams are executed lazily by the output operations, similar to how RDDs are lazily executed by RDD actions; RDD actions inside the DStream output operations force the processing of the received data."}
{"question": "What happens if a DStream application lacks output operations or has output operations without RDD actions?", "answer": "If a DStream application does not have any output operation, or has output operations without any RDD action inside them, then nothing will get executed, and the system will simply receive the data and discard it."}
{"question": "How can you integrate DataFrame and SQL operations with streaming data?", "answer": "You can use DataFrame and SQL operations on streaming data by creating a SparkSession using the SparkContext that the StreamingContext is using, and this SparkSession should be lazily instantiated to handle driver failures."}
{"question": "How is a singleton instance of SparkSession created and used in a streaming application?", "answer": "A lazily instantiated singleton instance of SparkSession is created using the `getSparkSessionInstance` function, which checks if the instance exists globally and creates it if it doesn't, ensuring it can be restarted on driver failures."}
{"question": "Within the `process` function, what steps are taken to perform DataFrame operations on a DStream of strings?", "answer": "Inside the `process` function, the RDD of strings is first converted to an RDD of Rows, then to a DataFrame, registered as a temporary table named 'words', and finally queried using SQL to perform word counts."}
{"question": "How does the code convert an RDD of strings to a DataFrame?", "answer": "The code converts an RDD of strings to a DataFrame by mapping each string to a Row object with a 'word' field, and then using the `createDataFrame` method of the SparkSession to create the DataFrame from the RDD of Rows."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of persisting a DStream's data in memory?", "answer": "Persisting a DStream's data in memory, using the `persist()` method, automatically persists every RDD of that DStream, which is useful if the data in the DStream will be computed multiple times, such as with multiple operations on the same data."}
{"question": "According to the text, what happens to DStreams generated by window-based operations like `yWindow` and `reduceByKeyAndWindow`?", "answer": "DStreams generated by window-based operations are automatically persisted in memory without the developer needing to explicitly call `persist()`."}
{"question": "What is the default persistence level for DStreams receiving data over the network, and how does it differ from RDDs?", "answer": "The default persistence level for DStreams receiving data over the network is to replicate the data to two nodes for fault-tolerance, but unlike RDDs, the default persistence level of DStreams keeps the data serialized in memory."}
{"question": "What are the two main types of checkpointing in Spark Streaming, and what does metadata checkpointing involve?", "answer": "The two types of checkpointing are metadata checkpointing and data checkpointing; metadata checkpointing involves saving information defining the streaming computation to fault-tolerant storage like HDFS to recover from driver failures."}
{"question": "What three pieces of information are included in metadata checkpointing?", "answer": "Metadata checkpointing includes the configuration used to create the streaming application, the set of DStream operations that define the streaming application, and incomplete batches whose jobs are queued but have not completed yet."}
{"question": "Why is data checkpointing necessary in some stateful transformations?", "answer": "Data checkpointing is necessary in some stateful transformations that combine data across multiple batches because the generated RDDs depend on RDDs of previous batches, leading to an unbounded increase in recovery time without periodic checkpointing."}
{"question": "What is the primary difference between the need for metadata checkpointing and data checkpointing?", "answer": "Metadata checkpointing is primarily needed for recovery from driver failures, whereas data or RDD checkpointing is necessary even for basic functioning if stateful transformations are used."}
{"question": "Under what circumstances must checkpointing be enabled in a Spark Streaming application?", "answer": "Checkpointing must be enabled for applications that use stateful transformations like `updateStateByKey` or `reduceByKeyAndWindow` (with inverse function), or if recovery from failures of the driver running the application is required."}
{"question": "What happens when `StreamingContext.getOrCreate` is called with a checkpoint directory that does not exist?", "answer": "If the checkpoint directory does not exist, the function `functionToCreateContext` will be called to create a new context and set up the DStreams."}

{"question": "How does `StreamingContext.getOrCreate` simplify the process of starting or restarting a streaming application?", "answer": " `StreamingContext.getOrCreate` simplifies the process by either recreating the context from checkpoint data if it exists, or creating a new context using a provided function if the checkpoint directory does not exist."}
{"question": "In the Java example, what does the `JavaStreamingContextFactory` do?", "answer": "The `JavaStreamingContextFactory` is a factory object that can create and setup a new `JavaStreamingContext`, including creating JavaDStreams and setting the checkpoint directory."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `excludeList` and `droppedWordsCounter` in the final code snippet?", "answer": "The `excludeList` is used to drop words, and the `droppedWordsCounter` is used to count the number of dropped words."}
{"question": "According to the text, what happens if `wordCount[0]` is found within `excludeList.value` in the `filterFunc`?", "answer": "If `wordCount[0]` is found within `excludeList.value`, the `droppedWordsCounter` is incremented by `wordCount[1]` and the function returns `False`."}
{"question": "What does the `WordExcludeList` object do, and how does it ensure thread safety when accessed?", "answer": "The `WordExcludeList` object provides a way to access a sequence of strings representing words to exclude, and it uses a `volatile` variable and a `synchronized` block to ensure thread safety when multiple threads attempt to access or initialize the `instance`."}
{"question": "How does the `DroppedWordsCounter` object ensure that its instance is initialized only once in a thread-safe manner?", "answer": "The `DroppedWordsCounter` object uses a `volatile` variable for its `instance` and a `synchronized` block to ensure that the initialization of the `instance` happens only once, even in a multi-threaded environment."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `excludeList` variable within the `foreachRDD` block?", "answer": "The `excludeList` variable within the `foreachRDD` block is used to retrieve or register the broadcast variable containing the list of words to exclude from processing, ensuring that each RDD partition has access to the exclusion list."}
{"question": "According to the text, what is recommended regarding the replication of received data when write-ahead logs are enabled in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "The text recommends disabling the replication of received data within Spark when the write-ahead log is enabled, as the log is already stored in a replicated storage system."}
{"question": "What configuration parameters are mentioned for enabling write-ahead logs with S3 or file systems that do not support flushing?", "answer": "The configuration parameters `spark.streaming.driver.writeAheadLog.closeFileAfterWrite` and `spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.closeFileAfterWrite` should be enabled when using S3 or any file system that does not support flushing for write-ahead logs."}
{"question": "What does the text state about the encryption of data written to the write-ahead log?", "answer": "The text states that Spark will not encrypt data written to the write-ahead log when I/O encryption is enabled, and if encryption is desired, the log should be stored in a file system that supports encryption natively."}
{"question": "What is suggested to do if the cluster resources are insufficient to process data as fast as it is being received?", "answer": "If the cluster resources are not large enough, the receivers can be rate limited by setting a maximum rate limit in terms of records per second."}
{"question": "What is 'backpressure' in Spark Streaming, and how is it enabled?", "answer": "Backpressure is a feature in Spark Streaming that automatically figures out and dynamically adjusts rate limits based on processing conditions, and it can be enabled by setting the configuration parameter `spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled` to `true`."}
{"question": "What are the two mechanisms described for upgrading a running Spark Streaming application?", "answer": "The two mechanisms are running the upgraded application in parallel with the existing one, and gracefully shutting down the existing application and then starting the upgraded one."}
{"question": "What is required for upgrading an application by shutting down the existing one and starting the upgraded one?", "answer": "This requires input sources that support source-side buffering, like Kafka, as data needs to be buffered while the previous application is down and the upgraded application is not yet up."}
{"question": "How does the block interval affect the number of tasks used to process received data?", "answer": "The number of tasks per receiver per batch will be approximately equal to the batch interval divided by the block interval; reducing the block interval increases the number of tasks."}
{"question": "What is the recommended minimum value for the block interval, and why?", "answer": "The recommended minimum value for the block interval is about 50 ms, below which the task launching overheads may become a problem."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using `inputStream.repartition(<number of partitions>)`?", "answer": "Using `inputStream.repartition(<number of partitions>)` distributes the received batches of data across the specified number of machines in the cluster before further processing."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Network Input Tracker in the process of data processing?", "answer": "The Network Input Tracker, running on the driver, is informed about the block locations for further processing, and an RDD is created on the driver for the blocks created during the batch interval."}
{"question": "According to the text, what happens when `blockInterval` equals `batchInterval` in Spark?", "answer": "When `blockInterval` equals `batchInterval`, a single partition is created and is likely processed locally."}
{"question": "How does increasing the value of `spark.locality.wait` affect block processing?", "answer": "A high value of `spark.locality.wait` increases the chance of processing a block on the local node."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `inputDstream.repartition(n)` method?", "answer": "The `inputDstream.repartition(n)` method reshuffles the data in RDD randomly to create n number of partitions, which can increase parallelism but comes at the cost of a shuffle."}
{"question": "What happens to jobs when using two DStreams in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "If you have two DStreams, two RDDs are formed and two jobs are created, which will be scheduled one after another."}
{"question": "What can happen if the batch processing time exceeds the `batchInterval`?", "answer": "If the batch processing time is more than `batchInterval`, the receiver’s memory will start filling up and will likely throw exceptions, most probably a `BlockNotFoundException`."}
{"question": "How can the rate of a receiver be limited in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "The rate of a receiver can be limited using the SparkConf configuration `spark.streaming.receiver.maxRate`."}
{"question": "What are the three types of guarantees a streaming system can provide regarding record processing?", "answer": "The three types of guarantees a streaming system can provide are at-most once, at-least once, and exactly once."}
{"question": "What does 'at least once' processing guarantee in a streaming system mean?", "answer": "At least once processing guarantees that each record will be processed one or more times, ensuring no data is lost, but potentially resulting in duplicates."}
{"question": "What is required for a streaming application to achieve end-to-end exactly-once guarantees?", "answer": "For a streaming application to achieve end-to-end exactly-once guarantees, each step – receiving, transforming, and pushing out the data – must provide an exactly-once guarantee."}
{"question": "According to the text, what fault-tolerance semantics do RDDs provide?", "answer": "RDDs are immutable, deterministically re-computable, distributed datasets that remember the lineage of deterministically re-computable transformations, providing guarantees for exactly-once data transformation."}
{"question": "What semantics do output operations in Spark Streaming typically ensure by default?", "answer": "Output operations by default ensure at-least once semantics because it depends on the type of output operation and the semantics of the downstream system."}
{"question": "What guarantees does Spark Streaming provide when processing data already present in a fault-tolerant file system like HDFS?", "answer": "If all of the input data is already present in a fault-tolerant file system like HDFS, Spark Streaming can always recover from any failure and process all of the data, giving exactly-once semantics."}
{"question": "What determines the fault-tolerance semantics of receiver-based input sources?", "answer": "The fault-tolerance semantics of receiver-based input sources depend on both the failure scenario and the type of receiver used."}

{"question": "What does the `dapplyCollect` function do, as demonstrated in the provided code example?", "answer": "The `dapplyCollect` function applies a user-defined function to a DataFrame and returns an R's data.frame, in this case, converting waiting time from hours to seconds by multiplying the 'waiting' column by 60 and adding a new column named 'waiting_secs'."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `gapply` function in Spark?", "answer": "The `gapply` function applies a function to each group of a `SparkDataFrame`, with the function taking a grouping key and an R data.frame corresponding to that key as parameters."}
{"question": "What is required regarding the output of the function used with `gapply`?", "answer": "The output of the function used with `gapply` should be a data.frame, and the schema specifies the row format of the resulting `SparkDataFrame` based on the R function’s output schema and Spark data types."}
{"question": "How is the schema defined when using `gapply`?", "answer": "The schema is defined using `structType` and `structField` to specify the column names and data types of the resulting `SparkDataFrame`, representing the R function’s output schema on the basis of Spark data types."}
{"question": "What does the `gapply` function accomplish in the provided code snippet?", "answer": "The `gapply` function determines six waiting times with the largest eruption time in minutes by grouping the DataFrame by 'waiting' and calculating the maximum eruption time for each waiting time."}
{"question": "How does `gapplyCollect` differ from `gapply`?", "answer": "Like `gapply`, `gapplyCollect` applies a function to each partition of a `SparkDataFrame` and collects the result back to an R data.frame, but the schema is not required to be passed."}

{"question": "What is an important rule regarding `SparkContext` objects within a JVM?", "answer": "Only one `SparkContext` should be active per JVM, and you must `stop()` the active `SparkContext` before creating a new one."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `persist()` method in Spark?", "answer": "The `persist()` method causes a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), like `lineLengths` in the example, to be saved in memory, allowing it to be used again later without recomputation."}
{"question": "According to the text, what happens when the `reduce` action is called on an RDD, and what is returned to the driver program?", "answer": "When the `reduce` action is called, Spark breaks the computation into tasks to run on separate machines, and each machine runs its part of the map and a local reduction, returning only its answer to the driver program."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `persist` method, and what `StorageLevel` is mentioned as an example?", "answer": "The `persist` method is used to save an RDD in memory after the first time it is computed, and `StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY` is mentioned as an example of a storage level that can be used with this method."}
{"question": "What issue arises when attempting to print the elements of an RDD in cluster mode using `rdd.foreach(println)` or `rdd.map(println)`?", "answer": "In cluster mode, the output to `stdout` being called by the executors is written to the executor’s `stdout` instead of the driver’s, so `stdout` on the driver won’t show the printed elements."}
{"question": "What method can be used to bring the entire RDD to the driver node for printing, and what potential drawback does it have?", "answer": "The `collect()` method can be used to bring the entire RDD to the driver node, but it can cause the driver to run out of memory because it fetches the entire RDD to a single machine."}
{"question": "What is a safer alternative to `collect()` when you only need to print a few elements of an RDD?", "answer": "A safer approach is to use the `take()` method, such as `rdd.take(100).foreach(println)`, which only fetches a specified number of elements."}
{"question": "What special operations are available on RDDs of key-value pairs that are not available on other RDDs?", "answer": "Distributed “shuffle” operations, such as grouping or aggregating the elements by a key, are special operations available on RDDs of key-value pairs."}

{"question": "What does the `map` transformation do?", "answer": "The `map` transformation returns a new distributed dataset formed by passing each element of the source through a function `func`."}
{"question": "What is the difference between `map` and `flatMap` transformations?", "answer": "Both transformations apply a function to each input item, but `flatMap` allows each input item to be mapped to 0 or more output items, returning a sequence rather than a single item."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `reduceByKey` transformation?", "answer": "The `reduceByKey` transformation, when called on a dataset of (K, V) pairs, returns a dataset of (K, V) pairs where the values for each key are aggregated using the given reduce function `func`."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `aggregateByKey` function in Spark?", "answer": "When called on a dataset of (K, V) pairs, the `aggregateByKey` function returns a dataset of (K, U) pairs where the values for each key are aggregated using the given combine functions and a neutral \"zero\" value, allowing for an aggregated value type that differs from the input value type."}

{"question": "How is the range of a session window determined when using dynamic gap duration?", "answer": "A session window’s range is the union of all events’ ranges which are determined by event start time and evaluated gap duration during the query execution."}
{"question": "According to the text, what types of joins between a streaming and a static DataFrame/Dataset were supported in Spark 2.0?", "answer": "In Spark 2.0, Structured Streaming supported inner joins and some types of outer joins between a streaming and a static DataFrame/Dataset."}
{"question": "What is a key difference between stream-static joins and stream-stream joins regarding state management?", "answer": "Stream-static joins are not stateful, meaning no state management is necessary, while stream-stream joins require managing the incomplete view of datasets at any given time to find matches between inputs."}
{"question": "What is required for outer joins when using watermarking in stream-stream joins?", "answer": "For outer joins, watermark and event-time constraints must be specified because the engine needs to know when an input row is not going to match with anything in the future to generate NULL results."}
{"question": "What does a watermark delay of \"2 hours\" guarantee in the context of stream processing?", "answer": "A watermark delay of “2 hours” guarantees that the engine will never drop any data that is less than 2 hours delayed, although data delayed by more than 2 hours may or may not get processed."}
{"question": "How are outer NULL results generated in stream-stream joins with watermarking, and what impacts the delay?", "answer": "Outer NULL results are generated with a delay that depends on the specified watermark delay and the time range condition, as the engine must wait to ensure there were no matches and will be no more matches in the future."}
{"question": "What is a potential issue with the generation of outer results in the current micro-batch engine implementation?", "answer": "The generation of outer results may get delayed if no new data is being received in either of the input streams being joined, as micro-batches are triggered only when new data is available."}
{"question": "What types of joins can be performed using the `impressionsWithWatermark.join()` function, as indicated in the text?", "answer": "The `impressionsWithWatermark.join()` function can perform \"inner\", \"leftOuter\", \"rightOuter\", \"fullOuter\", and \"leftSemi\" joins."}
{"question": "What is the primary challenge when joining two streaming datasets?", "answer": "The primary challenge of generating join results between two data streams is that, at any point in time, the view of the dataset is incomplete for both sides of the join, making it harder to find matches between inputs."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of applying watermarks to event-time columns in streaming data?", "answer": "Applying watermarks to event-time columns allows the engine to determine when it's safe to discard late-arriving data and to generate correct results, especially for outer joins."}
{"question": "How are event-time constraints expressed when joining `impressionsWithWatermark` and `clicksWithWatermark`?", "answer": "Event-time constraints are expressed using an expression that checks if `clickAdId` equals `impressionAdId`, `clickTime` is greater than or equal to `impressionTime`, and `clickTime` is less than or equal to `impressionTime` plus an interval of 1 hour."}

{"question": "What types of stream-static outer joins are not yet supported?", "answer": "Some types of stream-static outer joins are not yet supported, and these are listed at the end of the Join section."}
{"question": "What is the significance of specifying the join type as \"leftOuter\" in the example code?", "answer": "Specifying the join type as \"leftOuter\" indicates that the query should perform a left outer join, which includes all rows from the left DataFrame and matching rows from the right DataFrame, filling in NULLs where no match is found."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `expr` function in the join operation?", "answer": "The `expr` function is used to define the join condition as a string expression, allowing for complex join criteria based on multiple columns and conditions."}
{"question": "How is the join condition defined when joining `streamingDf` and `staticDf` based on the `value` column?", "answer": "The join condition is defined as `streamingDf$value == staticDf$value`, indicating that rows should be joined where the `value` column in both DataFrames is equal."}
{"question": "What is the effect of not receiving new data in one of the input streams during a stream-stream join?", "answer": "If one of the input streams does not receive new data, the generation of the outer result may be delayed because micro-batches are triggered only when new data is available."}
{"question": "What are the semantic guarantees of stream-stream outer joins with watermarking?", "answer": "Outer joins have the same guarantees as inner joins regarding watermark delays and whether data will be dropped or not."}
{"question": "How can you deduplicate records in a data stream using a unique identifier and a time range?", "answer": "Specifically for streaming, you can deduplicate records in data streams using a unique identifier within the time range of a watermark, and if you set a watermark delay threshold like “1 hour”, duplicated events within that hour can be correctly deduplicated."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using `withWatermark` and `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark` in a streaming context?", "answer": "The `withWatermark` function defines a time range, and `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark` then deduplicates records based on a unique identifier within that defined time window, allowing for efficient handling of potentially duplicated events."}
{"question": "What should users consider when setting the delay threshold for a watermark?", "answer": "Users are encouraged to set the delay threshold of the watermark longer than the maximum timestamp differences among duplicated events to ensure correct deduplication."}
{"question": "What happens if you attempt to use operations like sorting on a streaming DataFrame/Dataset?", "answer": "If you try to perform operations like sorting on a streaming DataFrame/Dataset, you will encounter an `AnalysisException` because these operations are fundamentally hard to implement efficiently on streaming data, as they require tracking all received data."}
{"question": "What is a state store in Structured Streaming and what does it provide?", "answer": "A state store is a versioned key-value store that provides both read and write operations, and in Structured Streaming, it's used to handle stateful operations across batches."}

{"question": "How does the `DownTimeDetector` class update its state when a new value is seen for a given key?", "answer": "Each time a new value is seen for a given key, the `DownTimeDetector` updates the `lastSeen` state value, clears any existing timers, and resets a timer for the future."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `state_schema` defined within the `DownTimeDetector` class?", "answer": "The `state_schema` defines the schema for the state value, specifically a timestamp, which is used to store the last seen timestamp for each key."}
{"question": "How is the downtime duration calculated within the `handleExpiredTimer` method?", "answer": "The downtime duration is calculated by subtracting the timestamp of the last observed event (obtained from `latest_from_existing`) from the current processing time in milliseconds (obtained from `timerValues`)."}
{"question": "What does the `handleInputRows` method do when it finds new data that is more recent than the existing state?", "answer": "When new data is more recent than the existing state, the `handleInputRows` method deletes all existing timers, updates the last seen timestamp with the new data's timestamp, and registers a new timer for 5 seconds in the future."}
{"question": "In the `DowntimeDetector` class, what happens if the latest timestamp from new rows is after the latest timestamp from existing rows?", "answer": "If the latest timestamp from new rows is after the latest timestamp from existing rows, the existing timer is cancelled, the `_lastSeen` state is updated with the new timestamp, and a new timer is registered to fire in the future based on the specified duration."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `handleExpiredTimer` method in the `DowntimeDetector` class?", "answer": "The `handleExpiredTimer` method calculates the downtime duration by subtracting the last seen timestamp from the current processing time and then registers another timer to fire in 10 seconds."}
{"question": "What are the two primary types of schema evolution supported by TransformWithState?", "answer": "TransformWithState supports schema evolution in two ways: evolution across state variables, which allows adding and removing variables between query runs, and evolution within a state variable, which allows changes to the schema of a specific state variable."}
