{"question": "What does setting `spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable` to `true` do?", "answer": "Setting `spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable` to `true` enables write-ahead logs, which provide stronger fault-tolerance guarantees by writing received data to a log before processing."}
{"question": "What potential issue arises when attempting to restart a Spark Streaming application from an earlier checkpoint after an upgrade?", "answer": "Restarting from earlier checkpoint information after an upgrade is not possible because the checkpoint information contains serialized Scala/Java/Python objects, and attempting to deserialize these objects with new, modified classes may lead to errors."}
{"question": "What are the two options presented for handling checkpoint issues after an upgrade in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "After an upgrade, you can either start the upgraded application with a different checkpoint directory, or delete the previous checkpoint directory to resolve potential compatibility issues with the checkpoint data."}
{"question": "What additional information does the Spark web UI provide when a StreamingContext is used?", "answer": "When a StreamingContext is used, the Spark web UI shows an additional Streaming tab which displays statistics about running receivers, such as whether they are active, the number of records received, and receiver errors, as well as information about completed batches, including processing times and queueing delays."}
{"question": "According to the text, which two metrics in the Spark web UI are particularly important for monitoring a streaming application?", "answer": "The two particularly important metrics in the web UI are Processing Time, which indicates the time to process each batch of data, and Scheduling Delay, which represents the time a batch waits in a queue for previous batches to finish processing."}
{"question": "What does it indicate if the batch processing time is consistently longer than the batch interval and the queueing delay is increasing?", "answer": "If the batch processing time is consistently more than the batch interval and the queueing delay keeps increasing, it indicates that the system is unable to process batches as quickly as they are being generated and is falling behind."}
{"question": "What interface can be used to monitor receiver status and processing times in a Spark Streaming program?", "answer": "The StreamingListener interface can be used to monitor the progress of a Spark Streaming program, allowing access to receiver status and processing times, though it is noted as a developer API likely to be improved in the future."}
{"question": "What are the two primary considerations for tuning a Spark Streaming application to achieve optimal performance?", "answer": "To achieve the best performance, you need to consider reducing the processing time of each batch of data by efficiently using cluster resources, and setting the right batch size to ensure data processing keeps up with data ingestion."}
{"question": "What is one way to improve performance by addressing bottlenecks in data receiving?", "answer": "If data receiving becomes a bottleneck, consider parallelizing the data receiving process by creating multiple input DStreams to receive different partitions of the data stream from the source."}
{"question": "How can multiple input DStreams be combined after being configured to receive different partitions of data?", "answer": "Multiple input DStreams can be combined by unioning them together to create a single DStream, allowing transformations to be applied to the unified stream."}
{"question": "What does reducing the block interval do in relation to the number of tasks used to process received data?", "answer": "Reducing the block interval increases the number of tasks that will be used to process the received data in a map-like transformation, as the number of tasks per receiver per batch is approximately calculated as (batch interval / block interval)."}
{"question": "What is the recommended minimum value for the block interval, and why?", "answer": "The recommended minimum value for the block interval is about 50 ms, below which the task launching overheads may become a problem."}
{"question": "What is one alternative to using multiple input streams/receivers for parallel data ingestion?", "answer": "An alternative is to explicitly repartition the input data stream using inputStream.repartition(<number of partitions>), which distributes the received batches of data across the specified number of machines in the cluster."}

{"question": "How does clearing old data work in Spark Streaming, and how can it be customized?", "answer": "Spark Streaming automatically clears old data based on the transformations used; for example, a 10-minute window operation will keep around the last 10 minutes of data and discard older data, but data can be retained longer using `streamingContext.remember`."}
{"question": "What is suggested to reduce GC overheads in Spark Streaming?", "answer": "To reduce GC overheads, it's suggested to persist RDDs using the OFF_HEAP storage level and to use more executors with smaller heap sizes."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between DStreams and receivers in terms of parallelism?", "answer": "A DStream is associated with a single receiver, so to attain read parallelism, multiple receivers—and therefore multiple DStreams—need to be created."}
{"question": "How are blocks of data generated by a receiver, and what determines the number of blocks created during a batch interval?", "answer": "A receiver creates blocks of data every `blockInterval` milliseconds, and the number of blocks created during a `batchInterval` is determined by the formula N = `batchInterval`/`blockInterval`."}
{"question": "What happens when `blockInterval` is equal to `batchInterval`?", "answer": "When `blockInterval` is equal to `batchInterval`, a single partition is created and is likely processed locally."}
{"question": "What is the effect of using `inputDstream.repartition(n)`?", "answer": "Using `inputDstream.repartition(n)` reshuffles the data in the RDD randomly to create `n` number of partitions, which can increase parallelism but comes at the cost of a shuffle."}

{"question": "What is the purpose of the `foreach` action, and what caution is noted regarding its use?", "answer": "The `foreach` action runs a function on each element of the dataset, typically for side effects like updating an Accumulator or interacting with external storage systems, but it's noted that modifying variables other than Accumulators outside of `foreach()` may result in undefined behavior."}
{"question": "What is the shuffle operation in Spark, and why is it considered costly?", "answer": "The shuffle is Spark’s mechanism for re-distributing data so that it’s grouped differently across partitions, and it’s considered a costly operation because it typically involves copying data across executors and machines, as well as disk I/O and data serialization."}
{"question": "How does the `reduceByKey` operation utilize the shuffle mechanism?", "answer": "The `reduceByKey` operation generates a new RDD where all values for a single key are combined, but since values for a single key may not reside on the same partition, Spark needs to perform an all-to-all operation to bring together values across partitions to compute the final result for each key – this process is called the shuffle."}
{"question": "What are some operations that can cause a shuffle in Spark?", "answer": "Operations which can cause a shuffle include repartition operations like `repartition` and `coalesce`, ‘ByKey operations (except for counting) like `groupByKey` and `reduceByKey`, and join operations like `cogroup` and `join`."}
{"question": "Why is the shuffle operation considered expensive in terms of memory usage?", "answer": "The shuffle operation can consume significant amounts of heap memory because it employs in-memory data structures to organize records before or after transferring them, and operations like `reduceByKey` and `aggregateByKey` create these structures on the map side, while ‘ByKey operations generate them on the reduce side."}
{"question": "What is RDD persistence (or caching) in Spark, and what benefits does it offer?", "answer": "RDD persistence (or caching) in Spark is the capability of storing a dataset in memory across operations, allowing future actions to be much faster, often by more than 10x, and is a key tool for iterative algorithms and fast interactive use."}
{"question": "What is the default storage level when using the `cache()` method in Spark?", "answer": "The `cache()` method is a shorthand for using the default storage level, which is `StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY` (store deserialized objects in memory)."}
{"question": "According to the text, what is the primary function of `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` storage level in Spark?", "answer": "The `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` storage level stores RDDs as serialized Java objects, one byte array per partition, which is generally more space-efficient than deserialized objects, especially when using a fast serializer."}
{"question": "How does `DISK_ONLY` storage level handle RDD partitions?", "answer": "The `DISK_ONLY` storage level stores the RDD partitions only on disk, providing a storage option when memory is limited."}
{"question": "What is the key difference between `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` and `OFF_HEAP` storage levels?", "answer": "Both `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` and `OFF_HEAP` store data in serialized form, but `OFF_HEAP` stores the data in off-heap memory, which requires off-heap memory to be enabled."}
{"question": "In Python, how are objects always serialized when using Spark storage levels?", "answer": "In Python, stored objects are always serialized with the Pickle library, regardless of the chosen storage level."}
{"question": "What does Spark do automatically with intermediate data during shuffle operations like `reduceByKey`?", "answer": "Spark automatically persists some intermediate data in shuffle operations, such as `reduceByKey`, even without users explicitly calling `persist`, to avoid recomputing the entire input if a node fails during the shuffle."}
{"question": "What is the primary recommendation regarding the use of `persist` after Spark automatically persists data during a shuffle?", "answer": "We still recommend users call `persist` on the resulting RDD if they plan to reuse it, even though Spark automatically persists some intermediate data during shuffle operations."}
{"question": "According to the text, what should you do if your RDDs comfortably fit with the default storage level?", "answer": "If your RDDs fit comfortably with the default storage level (`MEMORY_ONLY`), you should leave them that way, as this is the most CPU-efficient option."}
{"question": "When is it advisable to use `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` and a fast serialization library?", "answer": "It's advisable to use `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` and a fast serialization library when RDDs do not fit comfortably with the default storage level, to make the objects more space-efficient while still maintaining reasonably fast access."}

{"question": "What does the `RDD.unpersist()` method do?", "answer": "The `RDD.unpersist()` method manually removes an RDD instead of waiting for it to fall out of the cache, freeing up resources."}
{"question": "What is the typical behavior of variables used in functions passed to Spark operations?", "answer": "Normally, when a function passed to a Spark operation is executed on a remote cluster node, it works on separate copies of all the variables used in the function."}
{"question": "What are broadcast variables used for in Spark?", "answer": "Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a read-only variable cached on each machine rather than shipping a copy of it with tasks, making it efficient to provide every node with a copy of a large input dataset."}
{"question": "How does Spark handle common data needed by tasks within each stage?", "answer": "Spark automatically broadcasts the common data needed by tasks within each stage, caching it in serialized form and deserializing it before running each task."}
{"question": "When is it beneficial to explicitly create broadcast variables instead of relying on Spark's automatic broadcasting?", "answer": "Explicitly creating broadcast variables is useful when tasks across multiple stages need the same data or when caching the data in deserialized form is important."}
{"question": "How are broadcast variables accessed within Spark code?", "answer": "Broadcast variables are accessed by calling the `value` method on the broadcast variable object, which provides access to the cached data."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of accumulators in Spark?", "answer": "Accumulators are variables that are only “added” to through an associative and commutative operation, allowing for efficient parallel updates and are used to implement counters or sums."}
{"question": "How can you track the progress of accumulators in the Spark web UI?", "answer": "Spark displays the value for each accumulator modified by a task in the “Tasks” table within the web UI, which can be useful for understanding the progress of running stages (though this is not yet supported in Python)."}
{"question": "How is an accumulator created in Spark?", "answer": "An accumulator is created from an initial value `v` by calling `SparkContext.accumulator(v)`."}
{"question": "What is the role of the `AccumulatorParam` interface when creating custom accumulator types?", "answer": "The `AccumulatorParam` interface has two methods, `zero` for providing a “zero value” for your data type, and `addInPlace` for adding two values together, allowing programmers to define how custom accumulator types are initialized and updated."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `doubleAccumulator()` and `longAccumulator()` methods in SparkContext?", "answer": "The `doubleAccumulator()` and `longAccumulator()` methods in SparkContext are used to accumulate values of type Double or Long, respectively, allowing tasks running on a cluster to add to the accumulator, while only the driver program can read its value using the `value` method."}
{"question": "How is an accumulator used in Scala to add up the elements of an array?", "answer": "In Scala, an accumulator is first created using `sc.longAccumulator(\"My Accumulator\")`. Then, the array is parallelized and each element is added to the accumulator using `foreach(x => accum.add(x))`. Finally, the driver program can retrieve the accumulated value using `accum.value`."}
{"question": "What must programmers override when creating their own accumulator types by subclassing `AccumulatorV2`?", "answer": "Programmers must override the `reset` method for resetting the accumulator to zero, the `add` method for adding another value, and the `merge` method for merging another same-type accumulator into the current one, along with other methods detailed in the API documentation."}
{"question": "What is the key difference between how accumulators are updated in actions versus transformations in Spark?", "answer": "Accumulator updates performed inside actions are guaranteed to be applied only once, even if tasks are restarted, while updates in transformations may be applied more than once if tasks or job stages are re-executed."}

{"question": "What are the benefits of using Kryo serialization compared to Java serialization in Spark?", "answer": "Kryo serialization is significantly faster and more compact than Java serialization, often achieving speeds up to 10 times faster, but it requires users to register the classes they’ll use in the program in advance for best performance and does not support all Serializable types."}
{"question": "How can you enable Kryo serialization in a Spark job?", "answer": "You can switch to using Kryo by initializing your job with a SparkConf and calling conf.set(\"spark.serializer\", \"org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer\") to configure the serializer used for shuffling data and serializing RDDs to disk."}
{"question": "Since when has Spark internally used Kryo serialization for shuffling RDDs with simple types?", "answer": "Since Spark 2.0.0, the Kryo serializer has been internally used when shuffling RDDs with simple types, arrays of simple types, or string types."}
{"question": "How can you register custom classes with Kryo serialization?", "answer": "To register your own custom classes with Kryo, you should use the registerKryoClasses method, providing an array of class objects like this: conf.registerKryoClasses(Array(classOf[MyClass1], classOf[MyClass2]))"}
{"question": "What should you do if Kryo serialization is still using too much memory for large objects?", "answer": "If your objects are large, you may also need to increase the spark.kryoserializer.buffer config to ensure it is large enough to hold the largest object you will serialize."}
{"question": "What happens if you don't register your custom classes with Kryo?", "answer": "If you don’t register your custom classes, Kryo will still work, but it will have to store the full class name with each object, which is wasteful of space."}
{"question": "What are the three main considerations when tuning memory usage in Spark?", "answer": "The three considerations in tuning memory usage are the amount of memory used by your objects, the cost of accessing those objects, and the overhead of garbage collection."}
{"question": "How much overhead can Java objects have compared to their raw data?", "answer": "Java objects can easily consume a factor of 2-5x more space than the “raw” data inside their fields due to features like the object header and internal data structures."}
{"question": "What is the approximate overhead of a Java String object?", "answer": "Java Strings have about 40 bytes of overhead over the raw string data, as they store characters as an array of Chars and keep extra data such as the length, and store each character as two bytes due to UTF-16 encoding."}
{"question": "How do linked data structures like HashMap and LinkedList affect memory usage?", "answer": "Linked data structures use a “wrapper” object for each entry (e.g., Map.Entry), which not only has a header but also pointers, typically 8 bytes each, to the next object in the list, increasing memory consumption."}
{"question": "What are the two main categories of memory usage in Spark?", "answer": "Memory usage in Spark largely falls under one of two categories: execution memory, used for computation in shuffles, joins, sorts and aggregations, and storage memory, used for caching and propagating internal data across the cluster."}
{"question": "How do execution and storage memory interact in Spark?", "answer": "Execution and storage memory share a unified region (M), and when one isn't using memory, the other can acquire it; execution may evict storage if necessary, but only until total storage memory usage falls under a certain threshold (R)."}
{"question": "What does the spark.memory.fraction configuration control?", "answer": "The spark.memory.fraction configuration expresses the size of M (the unified memory region) as a fraction of the (JVM heap space - 300MiB), with a default value of 0.6."}
{"question": "How can you determine the memory consumption of an RDD?", "answer": "The best way to determine the memory consumption of a dataset is to create an RDD, put it into cache, and look at the “Storage” page in the Spark web UI, which will tell you how much memory the RDD is occupying."}
{"question": "What is the SizeEstimator used for?", "answer": "The SizeEstimator’s estimate method is useful for experimenting with different data layouts to trim memory usage, as well as determining the amount of space a broadcast variable will occupy on each executor heap."}
{"question": "What is one way to reduce memory consumption by changing your data structures?", "answer": "One way to reduce memory consumption is to design your data structures to prefer arrays of objects and primitive types instead of the standard Java or Scala collection classes."}
{"question": "What does the JVM flag -XX:+UseCompressedOops do?", "answer": "-XX:+UseCompressedOops makes pointers be four bytes instead of eight, which can reduce memory usage, and can be added in spark-env.sh if you have less than 32 GiB of RAM."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of storing RDDs in serialized form?", "answer": "Storing RDDs in serialized form, using StorageLevels like MEMORY_ONLY_SER, reduces memory usage by storing each RDD partition as one large byte array."}
{"question": "Why is Kryo recommended when storing data in serialized form?", "answer": "Kryo is highly recommended when storing data in serialized form because it leads to much smaller sizes than Java serialization and certainly than raw Java objects."}
{"question": "When might JVM garbage collection become a problem in Spark?", "answer": "JVM garbage collection can be a problem when you have large “churn” in terms of the RDDs stored by your program, meaning frequent object creation and destruction."}
{"question": "According to the text, what is the relationship between the number of Java objects and the cost of garbage collection?", "answer": "The cost of garbage collection is proportional to the number of Java objects, meaning that using data structures with fewer objects can greatly lower this cost."}
{"question": "What is the first thing the text suggests trying if garbage collection (GC) is a problem?", "answer": "The first thing to try if GC is a problem is to use serialized caching."}
{"question": "How can interference between tasks’ working memory and cached RDDs cause problems with garbage collection?", "answer": "GC can be a problem due to interference between your tasks’ working memory and the RDDs cached on your nodes, and this can be mitigated by controlling the space allocated to the RDD cache."}
{"question": "What Java options can be added to collect statistics on garbage collection frequency and time spent in GC?", "answer": "To collect statistics on how frequently garbage collection occurs and the amount of time spent in GC, you can add -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps to the Java options."}
{"question": "Where can you find the garbage collection logs printed when using the specified Java options?", "answer": "The garbage collection logs will be found on your cluster’s worker nodes in the stdout files in their work directories, not on your driver program."}
{"question": "What are the two main regions into which Java Heap space is divided?", "answer": "Java Heap space is divided into two regions: Young and Old."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Young generation in Java memory management?", "answer": "The Young generation is meant to hold short-lived objects."}
{"question": "Describe the simplified process of a minor GC in the Young generation.", "answer": "When Eden is full, a minor GC is run on Eden and objects that are alive from Eden and Survivor1 are copied to Survivor2, and the Survivor regions are then swapped."}
{"question": "What is the primary goal of GC tuning in Spark?", "answer": "The goal of GC tuning in Spark is to ensure that only long-lived RDDs are stored in the Old generation and that the Young generation is sufficiently sized to store short-lived objects."}
{"question": "What does the text suggest doing if a full GC is invoked multiple times before a task completes?", "answer": "If a full GC is invoked multiple times before a task completes, it means that there isn’t enough memory available for executing tasks."}
{"question": "If there are too many minor collections but not many major GCs, what does the text suggest?", "answer": "If there are too many minor collections but not many major GCs, allocating more memory for Eden would help."}
{"question": "How can the size of the Young generation be set, given the size of Eden (E)?", "answer": "The size of the Young generation can be set using the option -Xmn=4/3*E, with the scaling up by 4/3 to account for space used by survivor regions."}
{"question": "What should you do if the OldGen is close to being full, according to the text?", "answer": "If the OldGen is close to being full, you should reduce the amount of memory used for caching by lowering spark.memory.fraction."}
{"question": "What is the default garbage collector used by Spark since version 4.0.0?", "answer": "Since 4.0.0, Spark uses JDK 17 by default, which also makes the G1GC garbage collector the default."}
{"question": "What adjustment might be important to make with large executor heap sizes?", "answer": "With large executor heap sizes, it may be important to increase the G1 region size with -XX:G1HeapRegionSize."}
{"question": "How can you estimate the size of Eden when reading data from HDFS?", "answer": "The size of Eden can be estimated by considering the size of the data block read from HDFS, accounting for decompression, and multiplying by the desired number of tasks’ worth of working space, for example, 4*3*128MiB."}
{"question": "What is recommended regarding monitoring garbage collection after making new settings?", "answer": "You should monitor how the frequency and time taken by garbage collection changes with the new settings."}
{"question": "How can you specify GC tuning flags for executors in Spark?", "answer": "GC tuning flags for executors can be specified by setting spark.executor.defaultJavaOptions or spark.executor.extraJavaOptions in a job’s configuration."}
{"question": "What is recommended regarding the level of parallelism for each operation?", "answer": "Clusters will not be fully utilized unless you set the level of parallelism for each operation high enough."}
{"question": "How does Spark automatically set the number of map tasks?", "answer": "Spark automatically sets the number of “map” tasks to run on each file according to its size."}
{"question": "According to the text, what are the different levels of data locality in Spark, listed from closest to farthest?", "answer": "The levels of data locality in Spark, from closest to farthest, are PROCESS_LOCAL, NODE_LOCAL, NO_PREF, RACK_LOCAL, and ANY."}
{"question": "What happens when there is no unprocessed data on any idle executor in Spark?", "answer": "When there is no unprocessed data on any idle executor, Spark switches to lower locality levels, either waiting for a busy CPU to free up or immediately starting a new task in a farther away place that requires moving data."}
{"question": "How does Spark typically handle the situation when it needs to move data from a distant location to a free CPU?", "answer": "Spark typically waits a bit in the hopes that a busy CPU frees up, and once that timeout expires, it starts moving the data from far away to the free CPU."}
{"question": "What is the primary focus of the guide discussed in the provided text regarding Spark application tuning?", "answer": "The primary focus of the guide is data serialization and memory tuning, with a recommendation to switch to Kryo serialization and persist data in serialized form to solve most common performance issues."}
{"question": "What is the primary concern regarding Spark security highlighted in the text?", "answer": "The primary concern regarding Spark security is that security features like authentication are not enabled by default, and it's important to secure access to the cluster when deploying it to an untrusted network."}
{"question": "According to the text, what does Spark currently support for authentication of RPC channels?", "answer": "Spark currently supports authentication for RPC channels using a shared secret, which can be turned on by setting the spark.authenticate configuration parameter."}
{"question": "How does Spark handle authentication secrets when running on YARN?", "answer": "For Spark on YARN, Spark will automatically handle generating and distributing a unique shared secret for each application, relying on YARN RPC encryption for secure distribution."}
{"question": "What does setting `spark.authenticate` to `true` accomplish?", "answer": "Setting `spark.authenticate` to `true` enables Spark to authenticate its internal connections."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `spark.authenticate.secret.file` configuration parameter?", "answer": "The `spark.authenticate.secret.file` parameter specifies the path to a file containing the secret key used for authentication, allowing Spark to load the secret from a file instead of relying on a configuration option."}
{"question": "What is the preferred method for encrypting RPC connections in Spark?", "answer": "The preferred method for encrypting RPC connections in Spark is TLS (aka SSL) encryption."}
{"question": "What are the two primary methods for encrypting RPC connections in Spark, and which is generally recommended?", "answer": "Spark supports SSL-based encryption and AES-based encryption for RPC connections. SSL is standardized and considered more secure, making it the preferred method, while the AES-based encryption is a legacy option that may be simpler to configure if only data encryption in transit is required."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `spark.network.crypto.authEngineVersion` property, and what are the recommended settings?", "answer": "The `spark.network.crypto.authEngineVersion` property configures the version of AES-based RPC encryption to use, with valid options being 1 or 2. Version 2 is recommended for better security properties as it applies a key derivation function (KDF) to ensure a uniformly distributed session key."}
{"question": "How does Spark handle the situation when both SSL and AES-based encryption are enabled in the configuration?", "answer": "If both SSL-based and AES-based encryption are enabled, the SSL-based RPC encryption takes precedence, and the AES-based encryption will not be used; a warning message will also be emitted to indicate this behavior."}
{"question": "What is the key difference between the RPC and UI implementations of SSL in Spark?", "answer": "The RPC implementation of SSL uses Netty under the hood, which supports a different set of options compared to the UI implementation that uses Jetty. Additionally, RPC SSL is not automatically enabled when `spark.ssl.enabled` is set, requiring explicit enablement for a safe migration path."}
{"question": "What is required in addition to enabling AES-based encryption for RPC connections?", "answer": "For AES-based encryption to be enabled, RPC authentication must also be enabled and properly configured, as it relies on this authentication mechanism."}
{"question": "What does the `spark.io.encryption.enabled` property control, and what is a strong recommendation when using it?", "answer": "The `spark.io.encryption.enabled` property enables local disk I/O encryption for temporary data like shuffle files and data blocks. It is strongly recommended that RPC encryption also be enabled when using this feature."}
{"question": "How are access control lists (ACLs) configured for the Spark Web UI?", "answer": "ACLs can be configured for either users or groups, accepting comma-separated lists as input to grant view or modify permissions to the application's UI.

{"question": "According to the text, what happens if a query is run in Update output mode and the data is late beyond the watermark?", "answer": "If a query is run in Update output mode, the engine will keep updating counts of a window in the Result Table until the window is older than the watermark, which lags behind the current event time by 10 minutes."}
{"question": "How does the engine determine the watermark in relation to the maximum event time?", "answer": "The watermark is set as (max event time - '10 mins') at the beginning of every trigger, effectively lagging behind the current event time by 10 minutes."}
{"question": "What happens to intermediate state for a window when the watermark is updated to 12:11?", "answer": "When the watermark is updated to 12:11, the intermediate state for window (12:00 - 12:10) is cleared, and all subsequent data is considered “too late” and therefore ignored."}
{"question": "What is the difference between Update Mode and Append Mode in terms of how data is written to the sink?", "answer": "In Update Mode, the engine keeps updating counts of a window to the sink, while in Append Mode, only the final counts are written to the sink."}
{"question": "What happens if you attempt to use `withWatermark` on a non-streaming Dataset?", "answer": "Using `withWatermark` on a non-streaming Dataset is a no-op, meaning it is ignored because the watermark should not affect any batch query."}
{"question": "How do tumbling and sliding windows differ?", "answer": "Tumbling windows are a series of fixed-sized, non-overlapping intervals, while sliding windows are also fixed-sized but can overlap if the slide duration is smaller than the window duration."}

{"question": "What are the required output modes for aggregation queries to utilize watermarking for cleaning state?", "answer": "The required output modes are Append or Update, as Complete mode preserves all aggregate data and cannot use watermarking to drop intermediate state."}
{"question": "What conditions must be met for watermarking to effectively clean state in aggregation queries?", "answer": "The aggregation must have either the event-time column, or a window on the event-time column, and `withWatermark` must be called on the same column as the timestamp column used in the aggregate, and before the aggregation itself."}
{"question": "What is the implication of a watermark delay of \"2 hours\" in the context of aggregation?", "answer": "A watermark delay of \"2 hours\" guarantees that the engine will not drop any data that is less than 2 hours delayed, meaning any data within 2 hours of the latest processed data is guaranteed to be aggregated."}
{"question": "What is the primary challenge when performing stream-stream joins?", "answer": "The primary challenge is that at any point in time, the view of the dataset is incomplete for both sides of the join, making it harder to find matches between inputs."}
{"question": "What types of joins are supported between a streaming and a static DataFrame/Dataset?", "answer": "Structured Streaming supports inner joins and some types of outer joins between a streaming and a static DataFrame/Dataset."}
{"question": "According to the text, why is it necessary to buffer past input as streaming state when performing stream-stream joins?", "answer": "The text explains that buffering past input as streaming state is necessary to match every future input with past input and accordingly generate joined results for both input streams."}
{"question": "What is a key difference between how inner joins and outer joins handle watermarks and event-time constraints?", "answer": "The text states that while watermarks and event-time constraints are optional for inner joins, they *must* be specified for outer joins because the engine needs to know when an input row will not match with anything in the future to generate NULL results correctly."}
{"question": "What potential issue can arise regarding the timeliness of outer join results in the current micro-batch engine implementation?", "answer": "The text explains that the generation of outer join results may be delayed if neither of the two input streams receives new data for a while, as watermarks are advanced at the end of each micro-batch and a new micro-batch is only triggered when new data arrives."}
{"question": "Why are watermark + event-time constraints required for semi joins?", "answer": "Watermark + event-time constraints are required for semi joins to allow the engine to evict unmatched input rows on the left side, ensuring it knows when a row on the left side will not match anything on the right side in the future."}
{"question": "How can you define a constraint on event-time across two inputs during a stream-stream join?", "answer": "A constraint on event-time across two inputs can be defined in one of two ways: using time range join conditions (e.g., `JOIN ON leftTime BETWEEN rightTime AND rightTime + INTERVAL 1 HOUR`) or by joining on event-time windows (e.g., `JOIN ON leftTimeWindow = rightTimeWindow`)."}
{"question": "In the ad-monetization example, what watermark delays and event-time range condition were specified?", "answer": "In the ad-monetization example, the watermark delays were set to 2 hours for impressions and 3 hours for clicks, and the event-time range condition specified that a click could occur within 0 seconds to 1 hour after the corresponding impression."}
{"question": "What does a watermark delay of '2 hours' guarantee regarding data processing?", "answer": "A watermark delay of '2 hours' guarantees that the engine will never drop any data that is less than 2 hours delayed, but data delayed by more than 2 hours may or may not get processed."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of defining additional join conditions to avoid unbounded state growth in stream-stream joins?", "answer": "Defining additional join conditions ensures that indefinitely old inputs cannot match with future inputs, allowing them to be cleared from the state and preventing unbounded state growth as the stream runs."}
{"question": "How is the join condition expressed in the provided code examples?", "answer": "The join condition is expressed using `expr` and includes checks for matching IDs and ensuring the click time falls within a specified time range after the impression time, such as `clickAdId = impressionAdId AND clickTime >= impressionTime AND clickTime <= impressionTime + interval 1 hour`."}
{"question": "What are the possible values for the `joinType` parameter when performing a join?", "answer": "The `joinType` parameter can be set to one of the following values: \"inner\", \"leftOuter\", \"rightOuter\", \"fullOuter\", or \"leftSemi\"."}
{"question": "What is a semi join, and how does it differ from other join types?", "answer": "A semi join, also referred to as a left semi join, returns values from the left side of the relation that have a match with the right side, and it requires watermark + event-time constraints to evict unmatched input rows on the left side."}
{"question": "What is the primary concern regarding the generation of outer NULL results?", "answer": "The primary concern is that the outer NULL results will be generated with a delay that depends on the specified watermark delay and the time range condition, as the engine must wait to ensure there are no future matches."}
{"question": "What is the significance of specifying a watermark delay?", "answer": "Specifying a watermark delay ensures that the engine will never drop any data that is less than the specified delay, although data exceeding the delay may or may not be processed."}
{"question": "How does the micro-batch engine affect the timeliness of outer join results?", "answer": "Because the micro-batch engine advances watermarks at the end of a micro-batch and only triggers a new batch when new data arrives, the generation of outer join results can be delayed if either input stream stops receiving data."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using watermarks in streaming aggregations and stream-stream joins?", "answer": "Watermarks are used to automatically handle late, out-of-order data and to limit the state size by allowing the engine to discard data that is considered too old to be relevant for future matches or aggregations."}
{"question": "According to the text, what guarantees do semi-joins offer regarding watermark delays and data loss?", "answer": "Semi joins have the same guarantees as inner joins regarding watermark delays and whether data will be dropped or not."}
{"question": "What is the support status of a stream-to-static inner join in streaming queries?", "answer": "A stream-to-static inner join is supported, but it is not stateful."}
{"question": "What is required when performing a stream-to-stream inner join to enable state cleanup?", "answer": "When performing a stream-to-stream inner join, you must optionally specify a watermark on both sides and time constraints for state cleanup."}
{"question": "What conditions must be met to correctly support a stream-to-stream right outer join?", "answer": "To correctly support a stream-to-stream right outer join, you must specify a watermark on the left side and time constraints for correct results, optionally specifying a watermark on the right side for all state cleanup."}
{"question": "What is required to conditionally support a stream-to-stream full outer join?", "answer": "To conditionally support a stream-to-stream full outer join, you must specify a watermark on one side and time constraints for correct results, optionally specifying a watermark on the other side for all state cleanup."}

{"question": "How can records be deduplicated in data streams?", "answer": "Records can be deduplicated in data streams using a unique identifier in the events, similar to deduplication on static data using a unique identifier column."}
{"question": "What is the difference between deduplication with and without watermarking?", "answer": "With watermarking, the query removes old state data from past records that are not expected to get any duplicates, bounding the amount of state maintained, while without watermarking, the query stores data from all past records as state."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `dropDuplicates` function in the provided code?", "answer": "The `dropDuplicates` function is used to remove duplicate records from a streaming DataFrame, either based on a single column (like 'guid') or multiple columns (like 'guid' and 'eventTime')."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark`?", "answer": "The `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark` function is used to deduplicate records within the time range of a watermark, allowing for the handling of events where event times might differ for the same records."}
{"question": "What is recommended regarding the delay threshold of a watermark when using `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark`?", "answer": "Users are encouraged to set the delay threshold of the watermark longer than the maximum timestamp differences among duplicated events."}
{"question": "How can you deduplicate using a guid column with a watermark based on an eventTime column?", "answer": "You can deduplicate using a guid column with a watermark based on an eventTime column by first applying `withWatermark` to set the watermark and then using `dropDuplicatesWithinWatermark` with the guid column."}
{"question": "How can you add a watermark to a streaming DataFrame based on an event time column?", "answer": "You can add a watermark to a streaming DataFrame based on an event time column using the `withWatermark` function, specifying the column name and a delay, such as `streamingDf.withWatermark(\"eventTime\", \"10 hours\")`."}
{"question": "What happens when a streaming query involves multiple input streams with differing tolerances for late data?", "answer": "When a streaming query has multiple input streams with different thresholds for late data, Structured Streaming individually tracks the maximum event time in each stream, calculates watermarks based on their respective delays, and then chooses a single global watermark to use for stateful operations."}
{"question": "By default, how does Structured Streaming choose the global watermark when dealing with multiple input streams?", "answer": "By default, Structured Streaming chooses the minimum of the calculated watermarks as the global watermark to ensure no data is accidentally dropped as too late, even if one of the streams falls behind."}
{"question": "Since Spark 2.4, how can you configure Structured Streaming to use the maximum watermark value as the global watermark?", "answer": "Since Spark 2.4, you can set the SQL configuration `spark.sql.streaming.multipleWatermarkPolicy` to `max` to use the maximum watermark value as the global watermark, potentially allowing for faster results but also increasing the risk of dropping data from slower streams."}
{"question": "What operators can be used for more advanced stateful operations beyond aggregations, introduced since Spark 2.2?", "answer": "Since Spark 2.2, the `mapGroupsWithState` and `flatMapGroupsWithState` operators can be used for more advanced stateful operations, allowing user-defined code to be applied to grouped Datasets to update user-defined state."}
{"question": "What is the recommended operator for building complex stateful applications in Spark 4.0 and later?", "answer": "Since the Spark 4.0 release, users are encouraged to use the new `transformWithState` operator to build their complex stateful applications."}
{"question": "What should be considered when implementing the state function in Update mode?", "answer": "In Update mode, the state function should not emit rows that are older than the current watermark plus the allowed late record delay."}
{"question": "What DataFrame/Dataset operations are not supported with streaming DataFrames/Datasets?", "answer": "Operations like `limit`, `take`, `distinct`, and sorting (except after aggregation in Complete Output Mode) are not supported with streaming DataFrames/Datasets."}
{"question": "What is a workaround for chaining multiple stateful operations on streaming DataFrames/Datasets in Update or Complete mode?", "answer": "A workaround is to split your streaming query into multiple queries, each having a single stateful operation, and ensure end-to-end exactly once processing per query."}
{"question": "What does the `count()` method return when used on a streaming Dataset, and what is the recommended alternative?", "answer": "The `count()` method cannot return a single count from a streaming Dataset; instead, you should use `ds.groupBy().count()`, which returns a streaming Dataset containing a running count."}
{"question": "What happens if you attempt to use an unsupported operation on a streaming DataFrame/Dataset?", "answer": "If you try to use an unsupported operation on a streaming DataFrame/Dataset, you will receive an `AnalysisException` indicating that the operation is not supported."}
{"question": "Why is sorting on the input stream not supported in Structured Streaming?", "answer": "Sorting on the input stream is not supported because it requires keeping track of all the data received in the stream, which is fundamentally hard to execute efficiently."}
{"question": "What is a state store in Structured Streaming, and what is its purpose?", "answer": "A state store is a versioned key-value store that provides both read and write operations, and in Structured Streaming, it's used to handle stateful operations across batches."}
{"question": "What is the default state store provider implementation in Structured Streaming?", "answer": "The HDFS backend state store provider is the default implementation of `StateStoreProvider` in Structured Streaming, storing all data in memory map initially and then backing it up with files in an HDFS-compatible file system."}
{"question": "What issues might arise when maintaining millions of keys in the state of a streaming query, and how can RocksDB help?", "answer": "Maintaining millions of keys in the state can lead to large JVM garbage collection (GC) pauses, causing high variations in micro-batch processing times; RocksDB provides a more optimized solution by managing state in native memory and local disk instead of the JVM memory."}

{"question": "How did Spark handle inferred schemas in releases 2.2.0 and 2.1.x, and what was the consequence of this behavior?", "answer": "In 2.2.0 and 2.1.x releases, the inferred schema was partitioned, but the data of the table was invisible to users, meaning the result set was empty."}
{"question": "What issue might arise when upgrading Spark and attempting to read views created by older versions, and how can it be resolved?", "answer": "Upgrading Spark can cause issues reading views created by prior versions because view definitions are stored differently; in such cases, you need to recreate the views using `ALTER VIEW AS` or `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW AS` with newer Spark versions."}
{"question": "What change was introduced regarding partition metadata storage in Hive metastore when upgrading from Spark SQL 2.0 to 2.1?", "answer": "When upgrading from Spark SQL 2.0 to 2.1, datasource tables began storing partition metadata in the Hive metastore, enabling the use of Hive DDLs like `ALTER TABLE PARTITION ... SET LOCATION` for tables created with the Datasource API."}
{"question": "How can you determine if a table has been migrated to the new format for storing partition metadata in the Hive metastore?", "answer": "To determine if a table has been migrated, you can look for the `PartitionProvider: Catalog` attribute when issuing `DESCRIBE FORMATTED` on the table."}
{"question": "How did the behavior of `INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE ... PARTITION ...` change for Datasource tables after upgrading from prior Spark versions?", "answer": "In prior Spark versions, `INSERT OVERWRITE` overwrote the entire Datasource table, even with a partition specification, but now only partitions matching the specification are overwritten."}
{"question": "What is the new entry point for Spark, replacing the old `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`, and are the older contexts still available?", "answer": "The `SparkSession` is now the new entry point of Spark, replacing the old `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`; however, the old `SQLContext` and `HiveContext` are kept for backward compatibility."}
{"question": "What changes were made to the Dataset and DataFrame APIs during the upgrade process?", "answer": "The Dataset API and DataFrame API were unified, with `DataFrame` becoming a type alias for `Dataset[Row]` in Scala, and Java API users needing to replace `DataFrame` with `Dataset<Row>`, along with deprecations of `unionAll`, `explode`, and `registerTempTable`."}
{"question": "How has the behavior of `CREATE TABLE ... LOCATION` changed in Spark 2.0, and what is the implication of this change?", "answer": "From Spark 2.0, `CREATE TABLE ... LOCATION` is now equivalent to `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ... LOCATION` to prevent accidental dropping of existing data in the user-provided locations, meaning tables created with a user-specified location are always Hive external tables."}
{"question": "What is the effect of dropping an external table created with a user-specified location?", "answer": "Dropping external tables will not remove the data, as they are designed to keep the data separate from the table metadata."}
{"question": "What happened to `spark.sql.parquet.cacheMetadata` in newer Spark versions?", "answer": "`spark.sql.parquet.cacheMetadata` is no longer used in newer Spark versions."}
{"question": "What change was introduced to the Thrift server's session mode in Spark 1.6, and how can the old behavior be restored?", "answer": "From Spark 1.6, the Thrift server runs in multi-session mode by default, where each JDBC/ODBC connection owns its own SQL configuration and temporary function registry, but this can be reverted to single-session mode by setting `spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.singleSession` to `true`."}
{"question": "What change was made to the behavior of `LongType` casts to `TimestampType` in Spark 1.6, and why?", "answer": "From Spark 1.6, `LongType` casts to `TimestampType` expect seconds instead of microseconds to match the behavior of Hive 1.2 for more consistent type casting."}
{"question": "What features were enabled by default in Spark 2.2, and how can they be disabled?", "answer": "Optimized execution using manually managed memory (Tungsten) and code generation for expression evaluation were enabled by default in Spark 2.2, but they can both be disabled by setting `spark.sql.tungsten.enabled` to `false`."}
{"question": "What change was made to Parquet schema merging in Spark 2.2, and how can it be re-enabled?", "answer": "Parquet schema merging was no longer enabled by default in Spark 2.2, but it can be re-enabled by setting `spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema` to `true`."}
{"question": "What changes were made regarding decimal column precision in Spark SQL?", "answer": "Unlimited precision decimal columns are no longer supported, and Spark SQL enforces a maximum precision of 38; when inferring schema from `BigDecimal` objects, a precision of (38, 18) is now used, and the default precision for DDL remains `Decimal(10, 0)`."}
{"question": "How has the parsing of floating-point numbers changed in the SQL dialect?", "answer": "In the SQL dialect, floating-point numbers are now parsed as decimal, while HiveQL parsing remains unchanged."}

{"question": "How does the JSON data source handle new files created by other applications?", "answer": "The JSON data source will not automatically load new files that are created by other applications; for a JSON persistent table, users can use `REFRESH TABLE` or `refreshTable` to include those new files, while for a DataFrame, the DataFrame needs to be recreated."}
{"question": "What new API was introduced for reading and writing data in DataFrames when upgrading from Spark SQL 1.3 to 1.4?", "answer": "A new, more fluid API for reading data in (`SQLContext.read`) and writing data out (`DataFrame.write`) was created, and the old APIs (e.g., `SQLContext.parquetFile`, `SQLContext.jsonFile`) were deprecated."}
{"question": "How did the default behavior of `DataFrame.groupBy().agg()` change, and how can the original behavior be restored?", "answer": "The default behavior of `DataFrame.groupBy().agg()` was changed to retain the grouping columns in the resulting DataFrame, but to keep the behavior from 1.3, you can set `spark.sql.retainGroupColumns` to `false`."}
{"question": "According to the text, how does the behavior of `DataFrame.withColumn()` change between Spark versions 1.3 and 1.4?", "answer": "Prior to Spark 1.4, `DataFrame.withColumn()` always added a new column with the specified name, even if a column with that name already existed, whereas in Spark 1.4 and later, it supports either adding a new column with a different name or replacing an existing column with the same name."}
{"question": "What change occurred regarding the `SchemaRDD` class when upgrading to Spark SQL 1.3?", "answer": "The `SchemaRDD` class was renamed to `DataFrame` in Spark SQL 1.3, as DataFrames no longer directly inherit from RDDs but provide most of the RDD functionality through their own implementation."}
{"question": "In Spark 1.3, how did the Java and Scala APIs change in relation to each other?", "answer": "In Spark 1.3, the Java API and Scala API were unified, and users of either language should use `SQLContext` and `DataFrame` instead of the separate Java-compatible classes like `JavaSQLContext` and `JavaSchemaRDD`."}
{"question": "What change was made to the way implicit conversions are handled in Spark 1.3?", "answer": "In Spark 1.3, implicit conversions for converting RDDs into DataFrames were isolated into an object inside of the `SQLContext`, and users are now required to write `import sqlContext.implicits._` to access them."}
{"question": "How did the location of UDF registration functions change between Spark versions?", "answer": "UDF registration functions were moved into the `udf` object within `SQLContext` in Spark 1.3, so users should now use `sqlContext.udf.register()` instead of the previous method."}
{"question": "What is Spark SQL designed to be compatible with regarding data storage and processing?", "answer": "Spark SQL is designed to be compatible with the Hive Metastore, SerDes, and UDFs, allowing it to connect to different versions of the Hive Metastore and work with existing Hive installations."}
{"question": "What is one important consideration when working with views created by Hive in Spark SQL?", "answer": "If column aliases are not specified in view definition queries, both Spark and Hive will generate alias names differently, and for Spark to be able to read views created by Hive, users should explicitly specify column aliases in view definition queries."}
{"question": "According to the text, what Hive features are currently unsupported in Spark SQL?", "answer": "The text lists several unsupported Hive features, including UNION, type, unique join, column statistics collecting, block-level bitmap indexes, virtual columns, automatically determining the number of reducers for joins and groupbys, meta-data only query, skew data flag, STREAMTABLE hint, and merging multiple small files for query results."}
{"question": "What is the only file format that Spark SQL supports for results shown back to the CLI?", "answer": "Spark SQL only supports TextOutputFormat for the file format when results are shown back to the command-line interface (CLI)."}
{"question": "What is one reason some Hive optimizations are considered less important in Spark SQL?", "answer": "Some Hive optimizations, such as indexes, are less important in Spark SQL due to its in-memory computational model."}
{"question": "How does Spark SQL handle determining the number of reducers for joins and groupbys, compared to Hive?", "answer": "Currently, in Spark SQL, you need to manually control the degree of parallelism post-shuffle using `SET spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=[num_tasks];`, whereas Hive automatically determines the number of reducers."}
{"question": "How does Spark SQL behave when processing queries that should only use metadata?", "answer": "For queries that can be answered using only metadata, Spark SQL still launches tasks to compute the result, unlike Hive which would not."}
{"question": "What happens when Spark SQL encounters a skew data flag in Hive?", "answer": "Spark SQL does not follow the skew data flags in Hive."}
{"question": "What APIs related to Hive UDF/UDTF/UDAF are unsupported by Spark SQL?", "answer": "Spark SQL does not support the `getRequiredJars` and `getRequiredFiles` functions for Hive UDF/UDTF/UDAF, the `initialize(StructObjectInspector)` function in `GenericUDTF`, and the `configure`, `close`, and `reset` functions in `GenericUDF`, `GenericUDTF`, and `GenericUDAFEvaluator`."}
{"question": "How does Spark SQL handle the `SQRT(n)` function when n is negative, compared to Hive?", "answer": "If n is less than 0, Hive returns null, while Spark SQL returns NaN when calculating `SQRT(n)`."}
{"question": "What is the default data source used by Spark SQL for all operations if not otherwise configured?", "answer": "The default data source used by Spark SQL for all operations is `parquet` unless otherwise configured by `spark.sql.sources.default`."}
{"question": "How can you manually specify the data source and extra options when loading data in Spark SQL?", "answer": "You can manually specify the data source by its fully qualified name (e.g., `org.apache.spark.sql.parquet`) or its short name (e.g., `json`, `parquet`, `jdbc`) along with any extra options you want to pass to the data source."}

{"question": "What happens when you use the `Overwrite` save mode?", "answer": "Overwrite mode means that when saving a DataFrame to a data source, if data/table already exists, the existing data is expected to be overwritten by the contents of the DataFrame."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the `saveAsTable` command?", "answer": "The `saveAsTable` command materializes the contents of the DataFrame and creates a pointer to the data in the Hive metastore, allowing you to save DataFrames as persistent tables."}
{"question": "What happens if you do not specify a custom table path when using `saveAsTable`?", "answer": "If no custom table path is specified when using `saveAsTable`, Spark will write data to a default table path under the warehouse directory, and this path will be removed when the table is dropped."}
{"question": "What is the default behavior when saving a DataFrame to a data source if data already exists?", "answer": "The default behavior when saving a DataFrame to a data source if data already exists is to throw an exception, which corresponds to `SaveMode.ErrorIfExists` or \"error\"/\"errorifexists\"."}
{"question": "What does the `Append` save mode do?", "answer": "The `Append` save mode adds the contents of the DataFrame to existing data if the data/table already exists."}
